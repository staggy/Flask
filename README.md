# Computer Science Capstone Project
By Carl Gager <br>
I am creating this repository to showcase what I have learned in Flask Development.<br>
I was the lead developer of our team and was responsible for managing pulls, structure, database, and deployment of our project.<br>
My teamate who was responsible for the CSS did a wonderful job but for this repository I have removed that code to simplify the HMTL templates and make it easier for people to learn from this project<br>

# How to Build

Open Flask. <br>
Create a new project and select flask as the type. <br>
remove app.py, the static and templates folders that are created by default. <br>
Download the project zip file.<br>
Open the zip file, open the team-project-team-8-main folder.<br>
Copy only the requirements.txt file inside of the team-project-team-8-main folder into the directory of the pycharm flask project.<br>
Select the terminal at the bottom of the flask window. <br>
Enter into the terminal 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.<br>

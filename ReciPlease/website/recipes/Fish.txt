CUT OFF TIP AND STEM of tomatoes; remove seeds and core. Slice tomatoes into flat slices; lay each slice flat. Cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips, pile strips; cut horizontally in 1/4-inch pieces. Reserve on a plate in refrigerator, covered. Chill 4 plates. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine juice, 1 tablespoon green peppercorns and salt. Bring to boil and reduce until only 2/3 cup remains. The mixture should be thick and syrupy. Transfer liquid to bowl and cool to room temperature. When cool, beat in oil to make "glaze." If the mixture has a very shiny appearance and seems like it's going to separate, add a few drops of water or orange juice. To serve, spoon glaze onto plates. Arrange sliced fish on top. Garnish with the orange sections, the remaining tablespoon of green peppercorns and the chopped tomato.

     3/4           cup  lukewarm water
   1 1/2          cups  high-gluten flour

pn Salt 1 1/2 tb Extra virgin olive oil 1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatoes 3 tb Extra virgin olive oil 1    Onion; thinly sliced 1    Garlic clove; minced 2 cn Tuna fish; 6-oz each -drained Coarse salt; to taste Ground pepper; to taste 8 tb Pine nuts; lightly toasted Fresh basil  Pizza Dough:  Combine the yeast with 1/4 cup of water. cover and leave until double in volume.  If the mixture does not rise, throw it away and use a fresh package of yeast. If using a food processor, fit the bowl with a steel blade and put the flour, salt, olive oil, yeast mixture, and remaining water into the bowl. Process until the dough forms a ball, about 20 seconds. Place the dough on a smooth surface and knead for a couple of minutes, adding more flour if the dough is too sticky. If using the hand method, combine the flour and salt and place the mixture on a smooth working surface.  Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, olive oil, and remaining water. Gradually work the flour into the liquid, using a wooden spoon. When the dough is too stiff to work with the spoon, knead until smooth and shiny, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add more flour if the dough gets too sticky. Put the dough in a large mixing bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rise for 2 to 2 1/2 hours in a warm place until tripled in size. Punch down the dough, sprinkle with flour, and knead for a minute. If not using until the next day, place in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate.  Grease a 12-inch pizza pan with oil. Roll out the dough with a floured rolling pin directly onto the pizza pan. Brush with olive oil.  Let rise for 1 hour. The pizza is now ready for filling. Pizza: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Peel the tomatoes either by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes or by charring them over a gas flame or under a broiler. Slip off the skins while the tomatoes are still warm. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan and soften the onion without browning it. Add the garlic and the tomatoes. Cook for about 20 minutes over medium heat, until the tomatoes are soft and the sauce has thickened. Add the tuna fish and mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the filling evenly over the pizza dough. sprinkle with the pine nuts and the remaining oil. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until done. Sprinkle with the basil and serve.

Slice potatoes crosswise into 1/2-inch round slices. Cook potato slices in a large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 6 minutes. Drain; cool. On each of 12 skewers, thread ingredients in the following order: a pepper to secure food, potato, pineapple, pepper, onion, salmon and another onion.

Repeat, beginning with potato, until each skewer holds about eight inches of ingredients. End each skewer with pepper to secure. Continue with remaining skewers. Place skewers in a 13 x 9-inch pan and drizzle Italian dressing over them. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or until time to grill. Prepare grill.

When grill is ready, lightly oil the grill tray to prevent kebabs from sticking. Grill kebabs, turning and basting often with barbecue sauce, about 6 - 7 minutes or until brown. Serve kebabs with lime wedge garnish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4                red snapper fillets (1 1/2 pounds)
                        Salt
                        Ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice -- (from 1 large lime)
       1        medium  onion -- sliced thin
       3        medium  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
       1        medium  diced
     1/4           cup  minced canned green chiles
       1    tablespoon  drained capers
       1   4 ounce jar  roasted red peppers -- sliced thin

TO PREPARE: Place the snapper fillets in a large nonreactive baking dish;
sprinkle the fillets with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper,
and lime juice. Let them stand 15 minutes.

TO COOK: Meanwhile, bring 1/4 cup water to boil in a large skillet. Add
onions; cover and simmer until softened, about 7 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, minced green chiles, capers, and 1/4 cup of the roasted
red peppers; cover and simmer until the tomatoes release their juice and
flavors blend, about 7 minutes. Add red snapper fillets; cover and simmer
5 minutes. Turn fillets and simmer, uncovered, until fillets are opaque
throughout, about 4 minutes longer.

TO SERVE: Transfer a red snapper fillet to each warm dinner plate. Spoon
some sauce over each portion and garnish with remaining roasted red
peppers. Serve immediately.

Marinating red snapper fillets in lime juice enhances their flavor without
adding calories. A salad of curly endive and thinly sliced fennel rounds
out this light, Mediterranean-style fish dinner.

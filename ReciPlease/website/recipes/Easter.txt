   4 3/4          cups  all-purpose flour (4 3/4 to 5 1/4 cups)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       2      packages  Fleischmann's. Rapid Rise Yeast
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt

                     Ginger and Sesame- Scented Rack of Lamb

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 24:00
Categories    : International                    Lamb                             
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         stalk  (1-inch) fresh ginger root
       2  medium clove  garlic
       1         large  orange
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  dark sesame oil
       2         racks  lamb -- chine bones removed

PREPARATION: Peel the ginger and garlic. Remove two 1-inch by 3-inch strips of zest from the orange. Squeeze 1/3 cup orange juice into the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and process until smooth. Put the lamb in a large bowl and rub the meat with the ginger paste. Refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours, turning the racks occasionally in the seasoning paste.

COOKING: Bring meat to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to high position and heat oven to 450:F. Wrap the rib bones in foil to prevent blackening and put the racks meat-side up in a shallow roasting pan. Spread any remaining ginger paste over the meat and roast for 10 minutes. Lower oven to 350:F and roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130:F (medium rare), 15-20 minutes.

SERVING: Let racks rest 5 minutes, cut into chops and serve immediately.

Serves: 4 to 6

Prep Time: More than 1 day

  "The rack, or rib roast is a very tender and elegant cut."

NOTES : Ask the butcher to remove the chine bone from each rack, to trim and "french" the ribs, remove the fell, and trim the fat to no more than 1/4-inch in thickness. To present the racks standing upright, slice a thin wedge of meat off the bottom of the eye. This creates a flat base and simplifies carving

     1/4           cup  slivered almonds

To make dough: Measure 2 eggs, milk, butter, water, salt, 3 1/4 cups flour, sugar, lemon peel and yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To make topping: Combine almond paste, 1/4 cup flour and 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white); knead 5 to 6 times or until smooth. Form into 1/2-inch balls; set aside.

To shape: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Divide dough in half. For wings, roll one half of dough to 10 W 5-inch oval. Arrange in center of greased large baking sheet, curving ends downward. For body, roll remaining half of dough to a triangle, 15 inches high and 6 inches wide (at base); place on center of oval. Fold over top third of triangle from left to right; shape to form dove head. Fold over bottom third of triangle from right to left to form tail. With sharp knife, slash wings and tail at 1-inch intervals to form feathers. 

Lightly beat reserved egg white; brush on dough. Arrange almond paste balls, 1/2 inch apart, on body, tail and wings. Press one slivered almond into each ball. Press clove into head for eye. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

     1/2           cup  chopped slivered almonds -- toasted
                        Confectioners' sugar frosting -- optional

In large bowl combine 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, orange peel, lemon peel, cardamom and salt. Heat milk, water, and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make soft dough. 

Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (For Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)

Punch dough down; turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in dates and almonds. Divide dough in half; shape into 2 balls. Place in 2 greased 8-inch round cake pans. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Bake at 350:F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks. Top with confectioners' sugar frosting, if desired.

Description:

                     Hippity Hoppity Popcorn Bunnies

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : Snacks                           
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5        quarts  popped popcorn
       1      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        GLAZE
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  vinegar
                        MATERIALS
      24         large  gumdrops
                        Wooden picks
                        Candies (Lifesavers and licorice drops)
       2                black licorice strings

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.

   1 1/4         pound  fresh white or crimini (brown) mushrooms
       3   tablespoons  butter -- divided
       1           cup  coarsely chopped onions

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Trim and slice mushrooms. In a large skillet, over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add onions; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Spoon into large bowl.

Melt another tablespoon of the butter in the same skillet. Add half of the prepared mushrooms; cook and stir until golden, about 5 minutes; remove to the bowl with the onions.

   2 1/4           cup  unbleached flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
       6         ounce  cheddar; sharp, shredded

     1/4           cup  butter

Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.  Combine the flour and salt, mixing well, then cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Sir in the cheese and sprinkle with water while mixing lightly with a fork, (From 6 to 8 Tbls of water maybe required), continue mixing until dough makes a ball.  Divide the dough into three equal portions and roll each portion, on a lightly flour surface, into a 14 X 7-inch rectangle.  Cut each rectangle into 2 7-inch squares. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon, then fill the centers of the apples topping each apple with butter.  Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar mixture over the pastry. Place an apple in each square and fold the corners to the center, pinching the dough at the top of the apple to seal.  Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  Top with whipped cream.

Next day, roll in oblong shape (very thin) and spread with jams.  Sprinkle coconut, nuts and cherries.  Roll up like jellyrolls. 

Bake in moderate oven (around 350 degrees) until brown.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Slice and serve.

NOTE:  To make a variety I use different types of Jams or Preserves to make a variety of flavors.  One of mine is with blueberry Preserves and Cherry Preserves.  But use you own imagination and taste.

In large bowl, mix 1 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt.
Heat milk, water and butter until hot to touch (125: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. With spoon, stir in enough additional flour to make stiff dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 50 minutes.*
Prepare Chocolate Nut Filling: In small bowl, combine chocolate chips, chopped candied cherries, chopped pecans and chopped dates.
Variation: Replace cherries in filling with additional 1/2 cup chopped pecans.
Punch dough down. Divide into 19 equal pieces. Flatten into 4-inch circles, making edges slightly thinner than centers. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of each circle. Pull up edges and pinch to enclose filling. On lower third of greased baking sheet, arrange 5 buns in a row, seam-side down with edges touching. 
Build tree with additional rows of buns - 4 buns in second row, 3 buns in third row, 2 buns in fourth row and one for top of tree. 
To make trunk: arrange 2 rows of 2 buns each at bottom of tree. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375: for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack. Frost top with Confectioners' Sugar Icing. Drizzle with Chocolate Glaze. Decorate with candied cherries, if desired.

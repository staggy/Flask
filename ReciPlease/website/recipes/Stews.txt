      50         grams  butter
   1 1/2     kilograms  hare or rabbit joints -- stewing veal or chic
     450         grams  leeks -- thickly sliced
       4        cloves  garlic -- chopped finely
     175         grams  pot barley
     900            ml  water
       3   tablespoons  wine vinegar
       2                bay leaves

      15                fresh sage -- roughly chopped
                        or 1 tblsp dried sage

In 7th century England, herbs were one of the few flavourings available to cooks and were used heavily... Melt the butter in a heavy pan and fry the meat with the leeks and garlic till the vegetables are slightly softened and the meat lightly browned. Add the barley, water, vinegar, bay leaves and seasoning. bring the pot to the boil, cover it and simmer gently for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or till the meat is really tender and ready to fall from the bone. Add the sage and continue to cook for several minutes.  Adjust the seasoning to taste and serve in bowls-- the barley will serve as a vegetable.

       2        pounds  stew meat -- cut in 1-inch chunks

       2        medium  onions
       2        medium  tomatoes -- roma best

       1                unsalted peanuts -- coarsely broken
       4                cooked rice -- hot

In a covered medium saucepan, cook meat, 1 1/2 cups water, salt, and pepper for 1 1/2 hours or until tender. Meanwhile, in covered electric blender container at low speed [nb: this is pre-Cuisinart], blend onions and tomatoes until smooth (or chop onions and tomatoes very fine.) In large skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook onion-tomato mixture for 5 minutes. Add meat mixture and peanuts, cook about 20 minutes until sauce cooks down slightly. Serve over hot rice.  [Allegedly] 6 Servings. Accompaniments: Pass small bowls of shredded coconut, orange segments, pineapple chunks, and fried onions to sprinkle over individual servings of stew, if you like. You can serve this with the JOLOFF RICE. (See recipe JOLOFF RICE)

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  stew meat -- (lamb or beef)
       2         small  pumpkin -- or 1 med-small pumpk
     1/2           cup  dried prunes
       3   tablespoons  tomato paste
       1      teaspoon  turmeric
     1/8      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2        medium  onion -- chopped
                        salt and pepper to taste
       1         pinch  saffron disolved in 1/4c. warm water -- optional

Brown the meat and add about 1 and 1/2 cups water.  Add tomato paste, turmeric, cinnamon, saffron and salt and pepper and sauteed onion.  Cook covered at a simmer for about 1 and 1/2 to two hours.  Meat should be tender and nearly falling apart stage.  You may need to add water during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the stated amount.  You don't want a watery stew. In the meantime, seed the pumpkin and slice into 2X2 inch pieces and peel.  Brown on both sides in corn oil.  The pumpkin should become brown in some places and somewhat flexible but not totally cooked.  Add to meat and cook covered an additional 20-30 minutes until tender but not falling apart.  A fork should go into the pumpkin easily but not break it up.  Add the prunes the last 5 minutes of cooking.  They shouldn't really cook too much but should get warm. Serve over hot basmati rice. 

Note on pumpkin:  Baking pumpkins are the best since they are sweeter and less stringy.  I have used jack o lantern pumpkins when feeling frugal and the dish was still good.  You want about twice the volume of meat in peeled pumpkin slices.

Cover and bake in 325 F (160 C) oven for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until oxtails are tender.  (If oxtails are fatty, prepare recipe to this point.  Cool and refrigerate overnight; remove fat before continuing.) Add carrots, potatoes, rutabaga, celery and remaining salt to stew. Cover and bake for about 45 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender and stew is heated through.  If desired, thicken stew with 2 tbsp of reserved seasoned flour blended with cold water.

       1        cloves  garlic, minced
       1    tablespoon  minced gingeroot
   1 1/2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1         stalk  bok choy
                        sweet red pepper, julienned
       1           cup  broccoli florets
                        carrot, shredded
       1           cup  sliced mushrooms (3 oz)

       2        ounces  buckwheat noodles (1/2 cup)
     1/2         pound  firm tofu, cut in 1/2" cubes
     1/4           cup  watercress leaves

GARNISH: blanched peapods, thin scallion slices, celery leaves, toasted sesame seeds, finely shredded lettuce or watercress leaves, Optional.  Place 1/2 cup of the vegetable stock in a Dutch oven or 3 1/2 - 5 qt saucepan and bring to a boil. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in remaining stock and soy sauce. Cover pot and bring to a gentle boil. Add remaining ingredients.  Test for doneness: noodles should be softened; vegetables should remain crisp/tender. Timing - about 8 minutes. Top each serving with one of the garnishes. VARIATIONS: - substitute 1 C cooked brown rice for the buckwheat noodles peppers, chopped water chestnut, chopped jicama root, shredded spinach, chopped celery, or bamboo shoots. EGG THREADS: In a small skillet, heat a little margarine. When it begins to bubble, add 1 egg beaten with a little cold water. Tilt the pan so the yolk mixture coats it in a thin layer, the thinner the better. When the egg is lightly cooked, turn it out onto a cutting board. Slice it into very thin strips with a sharp knife. (makes about 1/3 cup)

       1    tablespoon  rice wine -- or dry sherry
       5   tablespoons  water
       2   tablespoons  rice vinegar -- or white vinegar

Use a sharp knife to cut between the spareribs.  Put the green onions in the bottom of a large saucepan.  Place the spareribs on top of the green onions.  Add the wine, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and water.  Cover and bring to a boil over high heat then reduce heat to low.  Cook about 2 hours, then serve hot.  Makes about 4 servings. 

Note: This recipe is really nice, and good for weekends.  I suggest you serve it with white rice to soak up all the liquid.  I think the name is supposed to indicate how simple it is - it's from an old chinese cookbook.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  stew meat
       4          cans  french green beans
       3        pounds  potatoes
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1                beef bouillon cubes -- optional
                        summer savory
                        salt
                        ground black pepper
                        some vinegar to season -- optional

Drain beans and use the liquid to boil the meat for about 2 hours at low heat.  Add about 1-2 teaspoon of salt (to taste!).  You get a better stock when you put the meat in the cold liquid, heat to boil and then continue cooking slowly. Peel potatoes and boil until done.  You needn't add salt because the beef broth will be salty enough.  Reserve the water as well; you may need it to add to the stew when it turns out to thick. Take the meat out of the broth after two hours and cut it apart.  You should add the lean parts to the stew.  Now add the drained beans.  Mash the potatoes and add them as well.  When you are lazy you might use instant potato puree, but that's not quite as good as the real thing. Heat the stew while stirring well.  If you consider it too thick add a bit of the reserved potato water.  (BTW, the right consistency *is* rather thick!) Season to taste with savory, pepper and salt. Optionally you can add a cube of beef stock, although that isn't really necessary (my Mom does, my Granny doesn't...).  I like to season the bean stew with vinegar, but this is also a matter of taste.  Just try and experiment a bit!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chorizo -- casings removed, cru
       1         large  onion -- cut into medium dice
      14        cloves  garlic -- coarsley chopped
     1/2           cup  dry sherry
     1/4           cup  olive oil
       3        pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- or butt, cut into 1"
       1    tablespoon  ground cumin
       1    tablespoon  coriander
       1    tablespoon  fennel seed
       2     teaspoons  dried oregano

      15        ounces  hominy, canned -- drained
                        juice from 3 limes
       1           cup  green onions -- finely chopped
       1           cup  cilantro -- finely chopped
                        salt and pepper, to taste

In a large pan, saute the chorizo over moderate heat til it loses its pink colour, about 3 min.  Remove with slotted spoon.  Saute onion and garlic in chorizo fat over moderate heat for 10 min.  Add sherry, and cook 4-5 min, til the liquid evaporates.  Add to the chorizo and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot.  When hot but not smoking, brown the pork cubes on all sides.  Return the pork and chorizo mixture to the pot, add the spices, oregano and beef stock.  Bring to a boil over high heat, scraping the bottom of the pot to remove any particles. Reduce heat to moderate, and cook 2 hours or til meat is tender.  Add the hominy and lime juice and cook 10 minutes.  Mix in the green onions and cilantro just before serving.  Serve hot. We usually eat it on top of rice.

       6        slices  bacon, thick-sliced -- chopped roughly
       3        cloves  garlic
       4                pigeons -- or other small game
       8        ounces  mushrooms -- chopped roughly
       3        ounces  hazelnuts or walnuts -- rough chop, roasted
   1 1/4          cups  ale -- real

                        salt and freshly ground black pepper
       6        slices  coarse brown bread

Use 6 birds if they are really small.  Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy bottomed casserole.  Add birds and brown on all sides.  Add the mushrooms and nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then add the ale and water with the bay leaves. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer very gently for 2 - 2 1/2 hours -- the birds should be falling off the bone.  Remove the birds from the juices, cool juices completely and remove any excess fat.  The birds can be served whole on or off the bone.  If the latter, carve them while they are cold then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently. Adjust the seasoning to taste and serve either the whole birds of the slices on the pieces of bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits".  A good green salad to follow is the best accompaniment.

Serve over the millet.

       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       3          cups  water

     1/4      teaspoon  saffron -- dissolve in 1tb. hot
     1/3           cup  yellow split peas

In large pot, brown onions in 3 Tbsp.  of oil or butter.  Add meat and brown.  Add salt, pepper, and cinnamon.  Add water, cover and simmer over low heat for 1 hr, stirring occasionally. Wash, but don't peel quinces. Use apple corer to remove seeds.  Slice as for apple pie.  In skillet, saute in 2 Tbsp.  oil or butter and set aside. To the meat, add sugar, vinegar or lemon juice, saffron, split peas, and quince.  Cover and simmer 35 minutes.  Check to see that meat and fruit are cooked.  Taste and correct seasoning.  Transfer to deep casserole dish and keep in warm oven until ready to serve.  Serve hot with chelo (recipe below.) CHELO 3 cups   basmati rice 8 cups   water 2 tblsp  salt 3/4 cup  melted butter 1/2 tsp  ground saffron, dissolved in 2 Tbsp. hot water 2 tblsp  yogurt (optional) Wash rice 5 times in cold water.  Bring water and salt to boil in a large non-stick pan.  Add washed and drained rice.  Boil 6 minutes, stirring gently twice to loosen grains that may have stuck to bottom. Drain rice in colander and rinse in lukewarm water. In same pot, heat half the butter, 2 Tbsp.  hot water, a drop of dissolved saffron, and yogurt. Taking one spatula at a time, place rice gently in pot mounding in the shape of a pyramid. Dissolve remaining butter in 2 Tbsp.  hot water and pour over rice. Place clean dishtowel over pot and cover firmly with lid to prevent steam from escaping.  Cook 10 minutes over medium heat and 50 minutes over low heat.  Remove from heat. Allow to cool 5 minutes on a damp surface without removing lid.  Put 2 Tbsp.  of the rice in with remaining saffron and set aside for garnish. Gently remove rice from pot without disturbing crust.  Sprinkle saffron flavored rice over top and serve.  Detach crust and serve separately. 

Note:  I am giving the detailed instructions.  I don't use the yogurt and I drizzle the remaining saffron over *all* the rice.  I also serve the tah dig (crust) with the rest of the rice.

       2    tablespoon  fresh marjoram -- chopped or 2 tsp dri
       2    tablespoon  fresh parsley -- chopped or 2 tsp dri

This began last night as an effort to make the Winter Vegetable Pie recipe in the _Fields of Greens_ cookbook just acquired (and thanks to those who sent advice on the book last month).  As usual, however, we varied a great deal, so the result is greatly different from the book's--but was wonderful. We realized that the recipe started with "Mushroom stock," which would take 3 hours to make.  Since it was already 7 in the evening, that was out.  The celery root we thought was in the vegetable bin was a rutabaga; we had six shitake to use up.  So we improvised: Stock:  Gently simmer, until reduced to about 2 cups liquid.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet; add the mushrooms, pinch of salt, 2 or 3 grinds of pepper.  Sear the mushrooms over high heat until golden.  Add half the garlic and deglaze the pan with half the sherry.  When the pan is almost dry, transfer the mushrooms to a bowl. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in stew pot and add the onion, pinch of salt, 2 grinds of pepper; saute until onion is transparent.  Add the remaining garlic, rutabaga, carrot, potatoes, and fennel, saute for 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms, herbs, and the reduced stock.  Cover and simmer until vegetables are soft and flavors melded, about 30 minutes over medium/medium low heat.  Serve over grain, pasta, or polenta (we used a mixed spiral spinach pasta and basmati rice left over from previous meals), with crusty bread, bread sticks, or pretzels. The _Fields of Greens_ book takes its mixture, pours it into a 9 inch round baking dish, then covers it with a white pastry cover, with an egg wash on it (there goes the vegan listing!), then bakes in 375 degree oven for 40 minutes. Our variation worked well; we ate at about 8:45 (which is fairly normal for us), a rich and warming stew with the temperature outside at -5, wind chill -37.  We'll try some different root vegetables next time, and perhaps add tofu slices as well.

Brown the cubed meat in the oil, add two cups of water, then the rest of the ingredients.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours.  Remove bay leaves, add carrots and potatoes, cook another 30-45 minutes or until tender. As a footnote, I've just browned the meat, then dumped everything in the "crockpot" on low.  It produces a stew that tastes as tho' it already been reheated several times.  IMHO, that's the best stew.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  lentils -- washed
       2         large  onions
       5        medium  tomatoes
       3   tablespoons  canola oil
                        water
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2     teaspoons  marjoram
   1 1/2     teaspoons  savory

In a medium-large saucepan boil lentils in water for about 30 - 40 minutes (or until thoroughly cooked).  While these are cooking, chop onions and tomatoes.  In a very large skillet or pan, sautee onions until they are just about cooked (mostly translucent).  Add tomatoes and stir occasionally.  Crush the marjoram and savory in your palm and rub together to release the flavor, and add to the pan.  Add the salt.  When it seems the tomatoes are fairly stewy and cooked, add the cooked, well drained lentils (which by this time should be done).  Cook together for a few minutes to get an even mixture. To cook quinoa, boil two parts water to one part quinoa.  Add grain (supposedly you're supposed to rinse it, but I don't have a fine enough colander, so I do without this step).  Cover and lower to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.  Stir and let sit covered off the heat for ten minutes before serving. This is a really good dish with steamed cauliflower and for a really neat touch, try adding some cooked arame seaweed on top.  Soak a handful of arame in cold water (you don't need very much of this - a little goes a LONG way, and it's very very dense in nutrition).  In a small pan heat some oil and add a couple cloves of chopped or pressed garlic, and a very small amount of diced ginger (optional).  Add drained and squeezed arame and saute for a few minutes. Add soy sauce to taste.  When the arame becomes crispy it's ready to eat. Just sprinkle on top of the stew, or any pasta dish for that matter.

Brown the beef with the onions in a large pot.  Once the meat is brown add 3 cups of water and bay leaves.  Heat over medium heat while you peel the potatoes and carrots. Add potatoes and carrots to the stew pot.  Cover with water.  Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender. Mix up a flour and water mixture to thicken the stew.  Add it right to the pot.  No need to remove the meat/veggies.  Stir well to make sure you don't get lumps. Add pepper/salt/whatever you like for spices.  I sometimes add garlic when browning the meat.  Oregano is a nice touch as well. Once the stew is thickened you can serve it.  Sometimes I make dumplings with the stew.  I usually buy a box of Bisquick as it has a recipe on it. Unfortunately I cannot relay the recipe to you as I don't have any in the house at the moment.  You would have to talk to my grandmother if you wanted to make them from scratch.  Isn't that the way it always is.

Cut into bite size pieces any vegetables you like, mainly, pot. carrots, onions, celery, etc. Purchase the least expensive piece of beef or chicken if you prefer and cut it into bite size pieces, removing most of the fat and marbling. Put it all mixed up into a crock pot with 1 can of Golden Cream of Mushroom Soup and 1 can of plain tomato soup, and about 1/2 to 1 can of cold water.  Cook 5-8 hours.  on slow or med., and you may not want to use any seasonings until after the first time.  Other than a little pepper, that is all I have ever needed to add.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  beef -- cubed
       3                carrots -- in large chunks
       4                potatoes -- cut into eights
       1         large  onion -- chopped
       2      packages  brown gravy
                        salt -- to taste
                        pepper -- to taste
                        water
                        flour
                        oil

Coat meat lightly with flour and brown in oil (or you can stick the coated meat on a broiler pan and brown it in the oven (saves time and has the added option of not being fried in oil). Put meat in stew pan (I used a large turkey roasting covered pan), add carrot chunks, potatoe chunks and onion.  Add enough water to cover everything and put in the oven @ 350 for 2.5 hours.  After the stew has been in the oven for approx.  1.5 hours add the packaged dry gravy (no need to mix it with water -- there should be enough water in the stew pan).  Mix it in well and continue stewing! This is great served with dinner rolls and a green salad.

       1         pound  bacon -- cut into 1/2-inch cu

Translation by Micaela "Stayka" Pantke - any mistakes are therefore mine. This recipe was taken from POLISH COOKING - Marianna Olszewska Heberle A harmonious blend of flavors known as the Polish national dish. Rinse sauerkraut with cold water; drain well.  In a large stockpot, combine sauerkraut, ham or pork, bay leaves, mushrooms, peppercorns, allspice and salt.  Add 6 cups broth, bouillon or water.  Cook, uncovered, 15 minutes over medium heat.  Cover and simmer over low heat 45 minutes.  Remove meat.  Let meat cool.  Place cabbage in a large saucepan.  Add remaining 5 cups broth, bouillon or water.  Bring to boil.  Cook, uncovered, over medium heat, 1 hour or until cabbage is tender.  Add to sauerkraut mixture.  Bone cooked meat.  Cut cooked meat into 1/2-inch cubes.  Melt butter or margarine in a large skillet.  Add cooked meat, smoked sausage and white sausage.  Saute over medium heat 10 minutes or until browned. Add to sauerkraut mixture.  In same skillet, saute bacon over medium heat until crisp.  Drain bacon on paper towels.  Add to sauerkraut mixture. Cover; cook over low heat 1 hour or longer.  Remove and discard bay leaves.  Serve hot.  Makes 12 to 14 servings. Use only meat with large bones, so bones can be removed easily.  The secret of old-time Bigos is that it gets better as it's reheated on successive days, peaking at the 6th or 7th day.  In between, store covered in the refrigerator.

       1                bouquet garni -- with plenty of thyme
      10                peppercorns -- crushed
       2        cloves  garlic -- crushed

                        salt
                        freshly ground pepper

Cut each type of meat into 6 even pieces.  Put them into 3 separate bowls and sprinkle generously with white wine.  Cover the bowls and refrigerate for at least 12 hours. Preheat the oven to 160 C (325 F). In a flameproof earthenware casserole, heat the goose fat over low heat, put in the onions and sweat for several minutes.  Lay the leek on top of the onions, then the potatoes.  Add the 'bouquet garni', peppercorns and garlic and arrange the 3 meats separately on top, one type to the left, one in the middle, one in the right.  Pour over the marinade and the remaining whine.  Salt lightly, add the chicken stock and lay the pieces of calf's foot on top.  Put the lid on the casserole. Mix the flour with a little cold water to make a soft paste.  Spread this paste between the top of the casserole and the lid to make an airtight seal. Cook in the low oven for 4 hours. 

Service: Present the casserole at the table just as is.  Break the seal and lift off the lid.

Note: This a Baeckenoffa, a beef, pork and lamb stew: this recipe is from Alsace.  Originally, the country people took their dish to the baker to cook in his oven.  They would arrive early in the morning, usually on the baker's closing day, when the fire had gone out, but was still warm - the perfect temperature to simmer this family dish very slowly without having to pay for the fuel.

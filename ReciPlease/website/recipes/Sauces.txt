                     Fresh Cranberry Sauce

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2     teaspoons  cornstarch
       2   tablespoons  orange juice -- freshly squeezed
       2          cups  cranberries -- fresh
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated
       2     teaspoons  orange zest

Mix together the orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside. 

In a saucepan add the berries, water, sugar, spices, and orange zest. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the cranberries are tender. Return the mixture to a boil and add the orange juice and cornstarch slurry. Stir well while simmering for another 3 minutes or so.

This sauce is good warm or cold and can go in any number of directions from this point. Add a bit of fresh thyme and black pepper for a more savory version. For a dessert sauce, add other fruits, such as pears, or walnuts for crunch. Experiment and enjoy!

Description:
  "Okay, I know this is pretty basic, but hardly anyone makes it, and
  it's so much better than the canned stuff. Furthermore, it can be used
  in many ways besides just a sauce for the turkey."

                     A Lucky Accident

Recipe By     : Recipe by Diane Lazarus

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3         small  carrots -- diced
       2         small  parsnips -- diced
       1        medium  turnip -- cut in chunks
       2        stalks  celery -- diced
       1         large  onion -- stuck with 2 cloves
       1           can  tomatoes -- with liquid
       1           can  tomato paste
       1  small   bunch  parsley -- flat-leaf
       1                bay leaf
                        fresh rosemary and thyme
                        black peppercorns

Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta insert. Add the tomato liquid and
tomato paste. Put all of the other ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. 

Lift out the pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.  Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small pasta to that.

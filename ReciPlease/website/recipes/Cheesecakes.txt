                     Cheesecake Hints

                        rita taule   (btvc62a)

Hi Claudia:  Here is a compilation of some "research" I did. I had to - 'cause I hate to tell you this - but; I get a perfect cheesecake every time, so other than the corn starch I was stumped. Here are some things I came across: 1.  Wrapping the pan with foil keeps it watertight. 2. If you grease the sides of the pan first, the surface will not crack when the cake starts to shrink on cooling. (It always shrinks a little). 3. Chill thoroughly before unmolding. In fact, I make my cheesecakes one day ahead of serving and leave it in the springform till I'm ready to use. 4. The water bath pan must NOT be higher than the springform pan or it will slow down baking. Also, put no more than 1" of water in pan. 5. Check oven temperature for accuracy. 6. When done, turn oven off, DO NOT OPEN DOOR, let sit for one hour. Then remove, place on a rack, and let cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 7. Use 1 Tbl cornstarch per 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese. Use Phila delphia brand cream cheese.  It is the best and works EVERY time. 8. IMPORTANT: Use  the egg size specified. If none is specified, use large (not jumbo or extra-large).

 Well, Claudia, this is all I can think of.  I hope some of these hints will be useful to you. There's nothing greater than a fabulous cheesecake. (Except, of course, maybe a flan) :)  That's my favorite!  Let me know what you think. Reetz formatted by Elaine Radis

Bake until a knife inserted 1-1/2-inches from the edge comes out clean, about 1 hour; turn off oven; leave cheesecake in oven with door ajar until top is firm to the touch, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, about 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours. Just before serving, remove cheesecake from pan to a serving plate. Garnish with sugared cranberries, kiwi slices and mint leaves, if desired.

 NOTE: To make sugared cranberries: In a small bowl place a small amount of white corn syrup.  Add fresh cranberries, a few at a time, turning to coat; then place in a bowl of granulated sugar. Using a fork, remove cranberries from sugar and place on a plate until ready to use.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       8                heath english toffee bars -- 1.4 oz size
                        -----crust-----
       9        ounces  chocolate wafer cookies
       3   tablespoons  butter -- melted
                        -----filling-----
   1 1/3          cups  heavy cream
       5   tablespoons  instant coffee crystals
      24        ounces  cream cheese -- softened
       1           cup  sugar

                        -----topping-----
      12        ounces  milk chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 325:. Coarsely chop 4 Heath bars. Finely chop remaining 4 bars. Reserve separately. CRUST: IN a food processor, grind cookies into fine crumbs. Add melted butter and process until mixed. Press into bottom and about 1" up sides of a 9 1/2" springform pan. Sprinkle coarsely chopped Heat bars over crust. Refrigerate while preparing filling. FILLING: In a 1-cup glass measure, combine 1/2 cup cream and coffee crystals. Heat in a microwave oven on HIGH 40-60 seconds, or until coffee dissolves when stirred. Refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes. IN a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Beat in 1/2 cup cream, eggs, and vanilla until well mixed, 1-2 minutes. With mixer on low speed, beat in chilled coffee-cream mixture; continue beating 5 minutes. Turn into prepared crust. Bake 1 hour and 15-20 minutes, or until cheesecake looks set around edges and center still jiggles slightly. Let cake cool; then refrigerate. TOPPING: When cake is cool, in top of a double boiler, heat together chocolate chips and remaining 1/3 cup cream, stirring often, until melted and smooth. Let cool in refrigerator until slightly thickened. Spread topping over cheesecake. Sprinkle finely chopped candy bars on top. Refrigerate until chocolate layer is set and cake is well chilled, 6 hours. Run a knife around edge of pan to loosen cake and remove springform side of pan.

                        nancy berry   (cwbj78a)
                        -----crust-----
       1           cup  fine graham cracker crumbs
                        (about 8 full crackers)
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- cold
                        cut into 1/4 inch pieces
                        -----filling-----
       1         pound  cream cheese -- at room temp.
     1/2           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  sugar
       2         large  eggs -- at room temp.
   1 1/4           cup  sour cream
       1    tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
   1 1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     2/3           cup  golden raisins
                        finely minced
       1    tablespoon  candied ginger -- or more
                        (to taste) finely minced

Here's the recipe you wanted from Ken Haedrich's Home For the Holidays cookbook. Butter the sides only of an 8-in. springform pan. Make the crust by mixing the cracker crumbs and 1 T. sugar in a bowl. Add the butter and rub it in until all of the crumbs are dampened by the fat. Distribute the crumbs loosely but evenly in the pan and press them in ; pushing them slightly up the sides. Cover and chill while you make the filling; preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Using an electric mixer, cream the cream cheese, honey, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the remaining ingredients and continue to beat until evenly blended; use the greater amount of ginger if you want a pronounced ginger flavor, the lesser amount for a subtle effect. Scrape the filling into the pan and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool the cake thoroughly on a rack--it will take several hours--then cover, still in the pan, and refrigerate for 12 hours before unmolding and slicing.

 Note: Ken Haedrich writes, "I have played around some with baking cheesecakes in a water bath, curious to see if it made any difference in the final cake. It seems to improve the texture a little bit, making it creamier. And I'm not sure if this is just a coincidence, but my water bath cakes don't split on top after they come out of the oven, perhaps Formatted by Elaine Radis

Just before serving spread salsa over top of cake and garnish with parsley and scallions. Serve with chips or crackers. Freezes well. **If you do not have ricotta, you can substitute an additional 8 oz. cream cheese. I have also topped this with William Sonoma's Geronimo peppers; (in addition to the toppings mentioned). Made for a very festive look. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find these anywhere else.

                        frances nossen   (swtk50b)
       4     8 oz pkgs  cream cheese -- or 5
                        (store brand -- not philly)
       2           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  real vanilla
       6                eggs -- beaten
      10         ounce  sour cream

So here's the recipe for a crustless cheesecake given to me by my friend of about 30 years; Len Simon.

 Soften cream cheese and beat until SMOOTH.  (I 'defrost' it in the nuker.) Add the sugar and vanilla and beat well. Add the eggs and sour cream. Pour batter into a buttered 10" round, 2" deep cake pan (or comparable springform). Place pan in another pan of water about 1/2" deep (I use my broiler pan) and bake @ 350 for 45 - 60 minutes or until top begins to turn a light toast color.  The cake will not be set. Remove from oven and cool, then refrigerate for about 2 hours. If you have used a springform pan, you can remove the cake and serve. I use the cake pan, so I freeze the cake in the pan. To de-pan, I turn a stove burner to high and move the pan around on the burner for about 45 seconds. Then I invert it over a plate. If the cake does not fall out of the pan, I give it another turn on the burner for about 10 seconds and try again. Sometimes, tapping the inverted pan on the bottom hastens the process. I then either wrap the cake and replace in freezer for later use or let it continue to defrost in the fri dge.

 AH, I guess these instructions are too detailed for you, but someone else may need them.  Anyway, this is a very basic, creamy cake...good served with canned toppings, fresh fruit, sauce of your choice, etc. It serves 10 to 16 people, depending on how many of them are watching their weight or cholesterol.  Can be re-frozen. I like it as is, but my uncle has added hazelnuts to the batter. Who knows  Formatted by Elaine Radis

                     How To Bake A Perfect Cheesecake

                        -----rita taule btvc62a-----
                        -----tips from rita-----

1.  Wrapping the pan with foil keeps it watertight.

 2.  If you grease the sides of the pan first, the surface will not crack when the cake starts to shrink on cooling. (It always shrinks a little).

 3.  Chill thoroughly before unmolding. In fact, I make my cheesecakes one day ahead of serving and leave it in the springform till I'm ready to use it.

 4.  The water bath pan must NOT be higher than the springform pan or it will slow down baking. Also, put no more than 1" of water in the pan.

 5.  Check oven temperature for accuracy.

 6.  When cheesecake is done, turn oven off, DO NOT OPEN DOOR, let sit for 1 hour. Then remove, place on a rack, and let cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

 7.  Use 1 Tablespoon cornstarch per 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese. Use Philadelphia brand cream cheese. It is the best and works EVERY time.

 8.  IMPORTANT: Use the egg size specified. If none is specified, use large (not jumbo or extra-large) size.

 Reetz says if all of these tips are followed, you should have a fabulous, non-falling cheesecake. She had to research all of this great information because as she says "cause I hate to tell you this - but, I get a perfect cheesecake every time." And I don't doubt that for a minute, Reetz.

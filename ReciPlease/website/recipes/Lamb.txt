                     Ginger and Sesame- Scented Rack of Lamb

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 24:00
Categories    : International                    Lamb                             
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         stalk  (1-inch) fresh ginger root
       2  medium clove  garlic
       1         large  orange
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  dark sesame oil
       2         racks  lamb -- chine bones removed

PREPARATION: Peel the ginger and garlic. Remove two 1-inch by 3-inch strips of zest from the orange. Squeeze 1/3 cup orange juice into the workbowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and process until smooth. Put the lamb in a large bowl and rub the meat with the ginger paste. Refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours, turning the racks occasionally in the seasoning paste.

COOKING: Bring meat to room temperature. Adjust oven rack to high position and heat oven to 450:F. Wrap the rib bones in foil to prevent blackening and put the racks meat-side up in a shallow roasting pan. Spread any remaining ginger paste over the meat and roast for 10 minutes. Lower oven to 350:F and roast until the internal temperature of the meat at the thickest point registers 130:F (medium rare), 15-20 minutes.

SERVING: Let racks rest 5 minutes, cut into chops and serve immediately.

Serves: 4 to 6

Prep Time: More than 1 day

NOTES : Ask the butcher to remove the chine bone from each rack, to trim and "french" the ribs, remove the fell, and trim the fat to no more than 1/4-inch in thickness. To present the racks standing upright, slice a thin wedge of meat off the bottom of the eye. This creates a flat base and simplifies carving

                     Ground-Lamb Kabobs with Green Peppercorn Sauce

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time : 4:00
Categories    : Grilled                          International                    
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2        pounds  ground lamb, very lean -- thrice ground
       3  medium clove  garlic -- minced
     3/4           cup  minced fresh mint
   1 1/2   tablespoons  minced fresh sage
       1      teaspoon  dried sage
       6   tablespoons  olive oil
                        Salt
                        Ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  dry bread crumbs
                        Green Peppercorn Sauce -- (see recipe)

TO PREPARE: Mix first 4 ingredients plus 4 tablespoons oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. (Can be refrigerated overnight.)

TO COOK: Prepare the Green Peppercorn Sauce recipe.

To finish the kabobs, heat the grill. If using wooden skewers, soak eight 8-inch skewers in water for at least 15 minutes. Stir breadcrumbs into lamb mixture. Divide mixture into 8 portions. Making 1 kabob at a time, form a portion of lamb into a compacted 4- by 1-inch cylinder. Skewer the lamb cylinder lengthwise. Repeat with remaining lamb to form 7 more kabobs. Brush kabobs with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.

Grill kabobs, turning occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes for medium.

TO SERVE: Transfer 2 kabobs to each plate. Drizzle a portion of the Green Peppercorn Sauce over kabobs and serve.

Serving Ideas: Serve these kabobs over Bulgur with Mushrooms and Almonds.

NOTES : Have your butcher grind the lamb three times through the finest die of his meat grinder. The resulting fine-textured meat better adheres to the skewer during grilling than does a coarser grind

                     Roast Leg of Lamb with Bulgur-Mint Stuffing

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time : 2:00
Categories    : Easter                           International                    
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  bulgur
       2   tablespoons  butter
       1         large  onion -- minced
       1      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  coarsely chopped walnuts -- toasted
       3   tablespoons  minced mint
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
                        Salt
                        Ground black pepper
       7        pounds  leg of lamb -- aitch and thigh bone

TO PREPARE: For the stuffing, bring bulgur and 3 cups water to boil in a medium saucepan. Cover and simmer until bulgur is tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. Drain bulgur and transfer to a medium bowl.

Heat butter in a skillet. Add onions; sauti until softened, about 3 minutes. Add onions, cinnamon, walnuts, mint, lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to the bulgur; toss. (Can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated overnight.)

Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon salt and 1/2 tablespoon pepper all over the leg of lamb. Spoon the Bulgar-Mint Stuffing into the lamb cavity. Fold the flap of meat over the stuffed cavity, completely enclosing the stuffing. Use a trussing needle and twine to sew the cavity shut. Starting at the shank end, wrap lengths of twine crosswise at 1-inch intervals around the stuffed leg of lamb, tying each length of twine in a knot to secure.

TO COOK: Heat oven to 400:F. Transfer stuffed leg of lamb to a roasting pan; roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the stuffed lamb registers 130:F, about 45 minutes. Transfer lamb to a carving board; let stand 10 minutes.

TO SERVE: Remove twine; cut roast crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve immediately.

Serves: 8 to 10

NOTES : Borrowing a common Middle Eastern technique of using bulgur as a stuffing, Cook's test kitchen staff developed this recipe. Have your butcher remove the aitch and thigh bones from the leg of lamb, leaving the shank bone intact. This boning technique creates a pocket for the stuffing while allowing the leg of lamb to retain its natural shape

                     Lamb with Cashew-Nut Curry (Korma)

Categories    : Ethnic                           Lamb                             
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  unsalted cashews
       3                dried hot red chilies
       1    2 in piece  stick cinnamon
       1     1 in cube  fresh ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  cardamom seeds
       3         whole  cloves
       2         large  garlic cloves -- peeled
       2   tablespoons  white poppy seeds
       1    tablespoon  coriander seeds
       1      teaspoon  cumin seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  saffron threads
       6   tablespoons  ghee (or melted butter)
       1           cup  chopped onion
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2           cup  unflavored yoghurt
   1 1/2        pounds  lamb -- cut into 2" cubes
       2   tablespoons  finely chopped coriander
       1    tablespoon  lemon juice
     1/4           cup  boiling water
       1           cup  cold water

To make the masala, combine the cashews, chilies, ginger and the cold water and blend at high speed for 1 minutes. Add the cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, garlic, poppy seeds, coriander seeds and cumin. Blend again until the mixture is completely pulverized. Set the masala aside.
Place the saffron in a small bowl, pour in boiling water and let soak for at least 10 minutes.
In a heavy skillet heat the ghee over moderate heat until a drop of water flicked into it sputters instantly. Add the onions and, stirring constantly, fry for 7 or 8 minutes, until soft and golden brown. Stir in the salt and the masala, then add the yoghurt. Stirring occasionally, cook over moderate heat until the ghee lightly films the surface.
Add the lamb, turning it about with a spoon to coat the pieces evenly. Squeeze the saffron between your fingers, thin stir it and its soaking liquid into the skillet. Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and cook for 20 minutes, turning the lamb cubes over from time to time. Scatter 1/2 of the fresh coriander over the lamb and continue cooking, tightly covered for 10 minutes more, or until the lamb is tender. To serve, transfer the entire contents of the skillet to a heated platter, and sprinkle the top with lemon juice and the remaining fresh coriander.

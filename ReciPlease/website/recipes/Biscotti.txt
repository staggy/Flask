--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  flour
       1           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon rind -- grated
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       2                eggs
                        -----vanilla cream-----
     2/3           cup  sugar
       3    tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
       3                egg yolks
       2           cup  milk
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       1      teaspoon  almond extract -- optional

Blend everything in large bowl and mix.  Roll out on floured board and cut with a four inch water glass. Make 12 circles.  Line greased cupcake pan with the 12 circles.  Fill each cup with pastry cream (below). Top each with another circle cut with a 3 inch glass--make sure the cake is sealed.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes at 375.  Let cool completely in pan.  This is my mom's cream-puff cream.  It's just a sweet, vanilla cornstarch pudding.  I'm giving you the microwave recipe, because otherwise it takes an eternity of stirring on the stove, after which your arm will fall off. If you choose to cook it that way, make sure you keep the heat low while you're waiting for the stuff to thicken, and never ever stop stirring, or the cream will stick to the bottom and burn and then you will have a million nasty little brownish-black flecks throughout your pudding, which will do absolutely nothing for the texture.  VANILLA CREAM  In microwave bowl, mix: 2/3 C sugar 3 T cornstarch 1/4 t salt  add a fraction of  2 C milk, a little at first to make a smooth paste, then the rest until the mixture is smooth.  Microwave this at high for 8-9 minutes, stirring every 2 min until the stuff is smooth and thickened.  Meanwhile, put 3 egg yolks (or two whole eggs) into another bowl and beat them slightly.  Quickly stir half of the hot milk mixture into eggs, and then add the new egg mixture to the original milk mixture. Microwave at high 1 to 2 min until mixture is thick and glossy.

Add 1 T butter 1 t vanilla extract (And, optionally, for extra flavor) 1 t almond extract  Let cream cool before adding to cupcakes or creampuffs...  If you're eating it by itself, it's great while it's still warm.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3                eggs
       2     teaspoons  anise extract
     3/4           cup  sugar
       1         pinch  salt
   1 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder

PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the eggs, extract, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and whip with a hand mixer set at high speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the whip. Continue whipping until the mixture is very light and increased in volume, 6-7 minutes. While the egg mixture is whipping, combine the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and stir to mix. Remove the whipped eggs from the mixer and sift over the flour mixture in three additions, folding it in after each addition with a rubber spatula. The batter will lose most of its air and become rather stiff. Pipe the batter, using a pastry bag with a 3/4-inch opening, but no tube, onto a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper or buttered wax paper. Pipe two logs about 1 1/2 inches wide and the length of the pan. Bake the logs about 20 minutes, until they are well risen and golden. Remove from  oven and place logs on a cutting board to cool about 10 minutes. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals. Place the biscotti cut side down on the pan and return them to the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until they color lightly on the cut surfaces.  Cool the biscotti on the pans and store them in a tin between layers of wax paper.

       2          cups  flour
   1 1/3          cups  sugar
       2         large  eggs
       1    tablespoon  lemon rind -- grated
     1/4           cup  sambuca -- anise-flavored lique

   1 1/2          cups  hazelnuts -- peeled,blanched,whol
       2   tablespoons  baking powder

Can use almonds instead of hazelnuts.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil a large baking pan and dust with flour.  Shake off excess flour.  Combine the flour, sugar, eggs, lemon rind, liqueur and rum in a mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until thoroughly blended. Beat in the hazelnuts (or almonds) and baking powder.  Using the hands, pick up half the dough [ick!] and shape it into a long sausage shape.  Arrange it on the prepared baking pan, off center and not too close to the edge of the pan.  Arrange the other half alongside but not too close.  Both masses will spread as they bake.  Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour.  Remove from the pan and let cool for 20 minutes.  Carefully and gently run a spatula or pancake turner under the 2 pastries. Let stand until almost at room temperature.  Using a serrated bread knife cut each pastry into cross-wise slices, each about 1-inch think. Arrange these in one layer on a baking sheet and return to the oven to dry out, about 10 minutes.  Let cool and store.  These cookies are improved if a little anisette or other anise-flavored liqueur is poured or brushed over them in advance of serving.

       2          cups  all-purpose flour -- more if needed

       2                extra large   eggs
     1/4           cup  dark rum
     1/4           cup  amaretto -- or nocello
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

       1           cup  walnuts
       1           cup  blanched almonds -- whole

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; lightly grease 2 cookie sheets with softened butter and dust with flour, shaking off the excess.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground almonds, sugar, eggs, rum, liqueur, vanilla extract, cinnamon and baking powder; beat with a heavy wooden spoon until well blended.  Stir in the walnuts and whole almonds. The dough should be soft and a bit sticky, but it should hold its shape when picked up.  If it is too runny, add more flour.  With your hands, scoop up half of the dough; shape into a long cylinder, about the length of a roll of paper towel.  Place on the cookie sheet so that it does not touch the edge of the pan.  Repeat with the second half of the dough.  Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown and firm.  They will spread during baking.  Remove the cookie sheets from the oven to a wire rack; let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.  Carefully loosen the cylinders from the cookie sheets, using metal spatulas.  Let stand on a cutting board until almost at room temperature.  With a serrated bread knife, cut each of the cylinders into crosswise slices about 1-inch thick.  Place the sliced, a cut side up, on the cookie sheets.  Return the cookie sheets to the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes to let the cookies out and turn slightly golden.  Cool completely before storing.

       2     teaspoons  baking powder

       2     teaspoons  almond extract
       2          cups  hazelnuts, oil-roasted -- coarsley chopped

These biscotti are perfect for dipping in espresso and the sweet Italian wine Vin Santo.  Since these cookies have no added shortening, there is very little moisture.  These cookies are hard, so crunch carefully.  Most important, enjoy!  I have substituted 2 cups roasted chopped almonds for the Hazelnuts and the results have been fine.  Also, I've been thinking about substituting 4 tablespoons of anise liquor for the Frangelico and tossing in a handful of anise seeds.  Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Mix dry ingredients (except the nuts) together in a bowl.  In a separate bowl mix the liquids.  Mix the liquids into the dry ingredients until the dough is stiff.  Do not overmix.  Stir in the nuts.  Shape the dough into 2 flattish logs 3 inches wide and approximately 15 inches long.  Place the logs on a buttered cookie sheet.  Bake for 20 minutes at 350.  Remove from the oven and let cool to the touch.  Using a bread knife, slice the log crosswise into 3/4 inch pieces. Place the pieces back on the cookie sheet side down.  Bake again for 15 minutes until the cookies are a golden brown.  Store in a tight tin.  Cookies store well for weeks.

Can substitute 1/2 teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda for bicarb of ammonia.

Be careful with the first baking of these biscotti. Even though they are baked a second time after being cut, if they do not bake sufficiently the first time, the biscotti will have a hard, heavy core.  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine all ingredients except honey and water in a mixing bowl and stir a minute or 2 to mix. Add the honey and water and stir until a firm dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and divide in half. Roll each half into a log about 15 inches long. Place both logs, well apart, on a jelly roll pan lined with parchment or buttered wax paper. Bake about 30 minutes, until well risen, firm and a dark golden color. Remove from oven, cool logs slightly and place on a cutting board. Slice the logs diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals.  Return the cut biscotti to the pan, cut side down, and bake an additional 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dry. Cool on the pan. Store in a tin--they keep well.

       1           cup  almonds -- whole, unblanched
       2          cups  unbleached flour -- unsifted
       1           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1         pinch  salt
       3         large  eggs
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla

This recipe makes about 4 dozen very crunchy biscotti.  I've never put chocolate on the biscotti.  You need two 12x15 inch (approx.) cookie sheets.  Butter and flour ONE of the cookie sheets.  The oven should be at 350 to roast the almonds, and 300 to bake the biscotti.  Total baking time for the biscotti is about 2 hours.  You also need to have handy and ready a surface for kneading the biscotti dough and a surface for cutting the baked biscotti.  Roast the almonds in a 350 degree often until lightly browned (10-15 minutes).  Cool nuts completely. Lower the oven temperature to 300.  In a medium bowl, stir together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, salt) just to mix.  Separate out about 1/2 cup of this mixture, and spread SOME of the reserved 1/2 cup onto your kneading surface.  In a small bowl or measuring cup, lightly beat together the eggs and vanilla.  Make a well in the flour mixture in the medium bowl and pour in the egg/vanilla mixture.  Stir the flour into the egg mixture from the outside of the well.  Continue combining until the mixture is too stiff to stir.  Turn the mixture out onto your kneading surface, which should already be floured with some of the reserved dry ingredients.  With floured hands (use some of the reserved dry ingredients for this if you want), fold the dough over itself until it coheres.  Use the rest of the reserved dry ingredients for your hands and the work surface, if necessary.  Press the nuts into the dough and keep folding the dough over itself until the nuts are evenly distributed.  Let the dough sit a few minutes so the flour absorbs the liquid completely, making the dough less sticky.  Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece with your hands so that the pieces are elongated into strips about 1" wide and 12"-14" long. *** Place the strips on the buttered/floured baking sheet, leaving about 4" between each strip.  If you want somewhat wider strips, flatten the strips with your hands to a width of 2".  Bake for about 50 minutes at 300.  Let the strips cool for 5 minutes, and them remove them with a spatula to a cutting surface.  Using a sharp knife and making downward strokes, cut the strips into diagonal bars about 1/2" wide.  Lay the cut biscotti on their sides on the two baking sheets.  Toast 35-50 minutes, depending on how dark (and crunchy?) you want them.  *** To make much wider strips, divide the dough into two strips, same length (12"-14").  Each cookie will be about 6" long.  This should make about 2 dozen cookies.

                     Biscotti 2

Recipe By     : ekman@netcom.com (Crossly the Glad-Eyed Bear)
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       1    tablespoon  almond paste
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       4         large  eggs
       2          cups  flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
       2     teaspoons  almond extract
       2   tablespoons  pine nuts
       2   tablespoons  confectioner's sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place a mixing bowl over hot but not boiling water, or use a big double boiler.  Put the sugar, almond paste, salt, and eggs into the bowl, and beat for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is lukewarm and looks like pancake batter.  Make sure that the almond paste is well beaten also. Take the bowl off the hot water and continue beating for another 5 minutes, or until the batter is cool and looks almost like frosting.  Sift the flour with the baking powder and fold it gently into the batter.  Add the almond extract and fold again.  Using a teaspoon, drop cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on buttered and floured cookie sheets, decorate with pine nuts, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.  Let stand about 5 minutes, and then bake for 15 minutes (at 350 degrees), or until toasty and crisp on the outside.

3. On a lightly floured surface, shape dough into 2 flat-bottomed cylinders, 1 in. high, 2 1/2 in. wide and 8 in. long. Remove each to the baking sheet. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly colored on top. Remove from oven and cool slightly. 

4. Holding a long sharp knife by the handle and tip; cut cylinders diagonally into 3/4-in. slices. Carefully place slices back on baking sheet, cut sides down; return to oven for 15 minutes more and bake until sides are golden and biscotti have dried a bit. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. The biscotti should be somewhat hard and crunchy. 

Yield: 20 to 24 biscotti.  You can also dip one end into some melted chocolate, for a nice effect and great taste.

Procedures for all recipes

Preheat oven to 350 degrees

Toast the almonds until golden, then chop by hand into 1/4 inch chunks. *Reduce oven heat to *325* degrees* Cream the butter until light, add the sugar and beat till smooth and creamy. Beat in eggs until the mixture is smooth. Add the (orange, anise, lemon) specific ingredients. Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, beat until just mixed. Stir in the almonds. On a floured board, divide the dough in half and roll each half into a long roll about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 10 inches long.  Set the rolls on a baking sheet at least 3 inches apart, bake in the top third of the oven (*325*) for about 25 minutes, or until they are set and lightly browned on top. Cool the rolls for 5 minutes or so, then slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay the slices flat on the baking sheet and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Turn the slices over and bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a rack, and keep in a tightly covered tin - they keep for months.

Roast almonds in a 350F oven for 10-15 minutes until lightly browned. Cool to room temperature.  Mix together dry ingredients in a large bowl reserving about 1 cup.  Lightly beat eggs and vanilla and add. Work mixture until dough coheres adding reserved dry ingredients if necessary. Add nuts and knead until they are evenly distributed. Divide into thirds and rest for a few minutes.  Then shape into slabs about 1" wide and 12-14" long.  Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and bake at 300F for 50 minutes. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes then cut diagonal bars 1/2" thick.  Lay the cookies on their sides and return to the oven for 50 minutes.  Store in a paper bag for 5-6 days before serving.  Yield: about 4 dozen.

The result depends heavily on your mixing technique and on the flour you use.  If your first batch resembles a sack of small bricks, try (try) again.

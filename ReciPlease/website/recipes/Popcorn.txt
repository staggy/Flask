     2/3           cup  raw popcorn

Pop the popcorn and place it in a large grocery bag. Place the margarine, corn syrup, salt, and sugar in a large bowl and microwave it on HIGH for 1 minute. Stir well. Microwave it on HIGH until it reaches a boil and then microwave it on HIGH for 2 minutes. Stir in baking soda, flavor and coloring (if desired). Pour over the popcorn and stir well, making sure the popcorn is well-coated. Roll the bag shut and microwave it on HIGH for 90 seconds. Stir well, roll shut and microwave it for 60 on HIGH. Roll the bag down (or tear it down) and leave open on its side. Microwave for 60 seconds on High. Pour out onto wax paper and spread it out to cool. When cool, break apart and remove any "old maids". Store in airtight container -- if it lasts that long ! This fills one of the 5 qt. ice cream buckets. For caramel corn: Use brown sugar instead of white and use vanilla or caramel flavoring. If you use the Lorann oils, one of the small bottles is the right amount of flavoring.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4   tablespoons  unsalted butter
       4          cups  mini marshmallows
       9          cups  popped popcorn
     1/2           cup  confectioners' sugar
       1    tablespoon  milk
                        gumdrops, cinnamon candies -- fruit leather, jelly
                        pretzels -- for garnish.

In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the marshmallows and cook, stirring often, until melted and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Place the popped popcorn in a large lightly greased shallow pan. Pour the syrup over the popcorn, tossing to coat evenly. While still warm, form 6 balls about 5" in diameter from the coated popcorn for the bottom sections, giving the balls flat bases so the snowmen will stand. Form 6 balls about 3-1/2" in diameter for the middle sections. Then form 6 balls about 2" in diameter for the top sections. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and milk together until smooth. Use the icing to stack three popcorn balls of decreasing sizes into a snowman, then attach candies to decorate. (Gumdrops for hats, fruit leather for scarves, etc.)

For variations, you may wish to substitute butterscotch morsels or use bitter chocolate. White chocolate pieces in place of chips make a pretty white candy which can be colored and molded into shaped cake pans. Yogurt candy coating can also be used for a more piquant flavor.

     2/3           cup  nuts; almonds -- pecans -or-
                        peanuts

Pop popcorn and remove old maids. Spread popcorn in a large flat pan and preheat in a 250: oven. In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Stir constantly until the mixture comes to a boil, and continue to boil without stirring for about 5 minutes (240:). Remove from heat and add soda and vanilla, stirring until foamy. If nuts are used, add them now, stirring until heated through and no longer clumped. Pour syrup mixture over preheated popcorn and stir to coat. Bake for about 30 minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times to evenly distribute the coating. Bake longer, about 60 minutes, for a more Crackerjacks-like taste. Cool, break up and store airtight.

       3        quarts  popped corn
       1       package  (10 1/2 ounces) miniature marshmallows
                        OR
       6          cups  miniature marshmallows

Keep popped corn hot in warm oven. Measure marshmallows, cinnamon candies, butter and salt into heavy saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until marshmallows are melted. Tint pink with food coloring. Pour mixture over popcorn, stirring gently to coat.
Shape mixture into bells. A coffee cup may be used to form bell and a saucer to form bell's lip as follows. Lightly butter inside of cup to keep corn from sticking. (Also lightly butter hands to work with hot popcorn.)
Press mixture into cup to form bell and onto saucer to form bell's lip. Quickly place 1/2 milk chocolate bar between bell and lip and press together. When bell has set, use a metal skewer to make hole through center of lip and bell in order to insert pipe cleaner for clapper.
Ribbon may be attached to pipe cleaner ends on top of bells and arranged in different lengths for hanging if this is desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5        quarts  popped popcorn
       1      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
                        GLAZE
       2          cups  sugar
   1 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  light corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  vinegar
                        MATERIALS
      24         large  gumdrops
                        Wooden picks
                        Candies (Lifesavers and licorice drops)
       2                black licorice strings

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cans  (7oz ea) tuna fish -- solid
       1           cup  cucumber; unpeeled -- cubed
       2          cups  red apples; unpeeled -- cubed
     1/2           cup  walnut meats -- coarsely chop
       1    tablespoon  oil
       1    tablespoon  tarragon vinegar
                        mayonnaise
       6      large  -  8 lg. gherkins*
       1                red apple
                        lemon juice

Drain tuna.  Flake and combine with cucumbers, cubed apples and walnuts. Blend oil with vinegar and enough mayonnaise for a not too thick dressing. Pour over salad ingredients and toss lightly. If desired, make a garnish by cutting gherkins lengthwise into slices, leaving sliced fastened at the base.  Spread out like a fan. Cut a quarter of an apple into thin wedges and dip in lemon juice. Place wedges lengthwise between gherkins slices. Shrimp Salad Waldorf Style equally delicious. Use canned or quick-frozen deveined shrimp, chopped. Yield 6-8 servings. *Gherkins is a small prickly fruit that used for pickling or somewhat like a baby cucumber.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                egg yolk
       1           cup  vegetable oil
       2   tablespoons  fresh squeezed lemon juice
       1      teaspoon  salt/pepper
       1    tablespoon  grey poupon mustard
     1/3           cup  roasted red pepper -- well
                        (jarred ones are fine)
                        tuna
                        scallions or shallots -- finely chopped;
                        celery; finely chopped

Have you tried making tuna salad with homemade mayonnaise? You can vary the flavoring in the mayonnaise to suit your taste. Try your next batch with this: Put the yolks, 1 Tablespoon oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and mustard into the bowl of a processor and process until an emulsion begins to form. Then, with the machine still running, begin to add the rest of the oil, almost drop by drop, until it's all incorporated and you have a thick mayonnaise. Mash up the red peppers until very fine and stir into the mayonnaise until it's completely incorporated. Taste and adjust seasoning to your own personal liking. Add to your tuna salad, along with some finely chopped scallions or shallots and perhaps some finely chopped celery. If you like curry in your tuna salad, this can be added instead of the red peppers, but add it at the same time you put the first ingredients into the processor.

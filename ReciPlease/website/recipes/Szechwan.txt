Add the crushed red pepper, garlic and ginger.Cook for 30 seconds  and  add  chicken   mixture. Cooking times vary according to appliance  used.  Cook  on high heat until done, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat, add 1/2 cup of peanuts.(I like to pulverize mine in a blender or  food  processor  first.    It  adds more of a peanutty flavor to the dish.)   Add the snow peas and soy sauce mixture,cover and simmer until snow peas are cooked to your taste. This dish is best served with plain white rice and is even tastier as a leftover. (It microwaves well) ENJOY! ! FROM:  HERBERT JORGENSEN (DNKX88A)

       4        slices  root ginger
     1/2    tablespoon  peppercorns
       4            lb  duck -- (4 to 5)
       1    tablespoon  sea salt
       2   tablespoons  lard
                        smoking:
       4            tb  dried tea -- (4 to 5)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1        bundle  camphor wood -- or
       4            tb  camphor wood sawdust -- (4 to 5)
                        some smoldering charcoal
                        a wire rack
                        inverted clean kerosene tin -- or inverted metal du

Shred & chop the ginger. Roast the peppercorns in a dry roasting pan for 10 minutes in a moderate oven; crush and pound them lightly in a mortar. Rub the duck inside and out with half the salt, ginger and pepper. Leave to dry and season overnight. Mix the remaining seasoning with the lard until well-blended. Rub the mixture on the duck inside and out. Place the duck on a wire rack in a preheated moderate oven at about 400 deg (put a drip-pan underneath) and roast for 1 hour. SMOKING: Light the charcoal fire. When the charcoal is glowing red, but not blazing, sprinkle half the tea, sugar and camphor wood (twigs or sawdust) over the fire. Place the duck on a wire rack and suspend it a couple of inches above the fire. Invert the tin or bin over the duck and fire and let smoke for 10 minutes. Turn the duck over for a further 10 minute smoking, sprinkling the rest of the smoking mixture on the fire and poking and stirring it. By now the duck should be sufficiently smoked. Brush it with 2 tb sesame oil and put it in a moderate oven for a further 15 minutes of roasting. Serve by chopping through the bones into 15-20 large bite-size pieces or carve in the western manner. An excellent accompaniment to wine at the start or a multi-course dinner party or banquet. Adapted from a recipe from the Chengtu Dining Rooms, Chengtu. From Chinese Regional Cooking by Kenneth Lo, Pantheon Books, 1979.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2                chicken breasts* -- split; boned and ski
     1/3           cup  pace picante sauce
      20   milliliters  garlic -- minced
       2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       1    tablespoon  ginger -- shredded
       1    tablespoon  water
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch
   1 1/2          cups  broccoli flowerets
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1                red pepper
       3   tablespoons  vegetable oil
       1                onion -- thin wedges

(We use much less meat than this; either 1 whole chicken breast or 1/2 lb. ground turkey or ground chicken.) Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Combine picante sauce, soy sauce, water, cornstarch and sugar in small bowl; set aside. Heat 2 T. of the oil in wok or large skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and stir-fry 3 to 4 minutes or until cooked through. Remove with slotted spoon. Add remaining oil onion, garlic and ginger to skillet; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add broccoli and peppers; stir-fry 3 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender. Add chicken and picante sauce mixture; stir-fry about 1 minute or until sauce thickens.

 I don't cook the meat and vegetables separately. It takes a little longer, but there are less dishes to wash and you only need 2 T. oil. I cook the garlic and ginger for a few seconds before throwing the meat in. I cook the meat for 20 or 30 seconds, and then throw in the vegetables one at a one at a time, stirring 5 or 6 seconds between each addition. I cook everything for 5 or 6 minutes, stirring, of course. Then I pull everything up on the sides of the wok and pour the sauce in the center, stirring the sauce until thickened. Then I stir everything together for a minute or two. It's done. I use high on my stove when cooking with my wok on a fire-ring. This is easy and delicious and lower in sodium than many of the bottled sauces. This recipe is from the Pace Picante Sauce 40th Anniversary Recipe Collection.

Mix above together and refrigerate for one hour (at least) Place above seasonings in bowl and set aside  Mix and set aside above sauce ingredients 3 C peanut oil for deep frying 1 tsp sesame oil Fry shrimp, or chicken in peanut oil. Place in bowl and set aside. Pour off all but 2 T oil and add seasonings and brown. Stir in sauce until bubbles. Return shrimp. Add sesame oil.

 This recipe is absolutely sensational.  However it does not make alot of sauce for rice.  I usually double the sauce ingredients. It is very hot. If you like food milder leave out some chilis. I have tried the General Taos chicken posted here on prodigy. My family prefers this recipe. My last attempt to post this recipe failed. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Add chicken broth, hoisin sauce, tomato paste, soy sauce and chili paste to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened. Incorporate veggie/pork mixtures and stir well. Add noodles and toss until well coated. Serve. This is also great as a cold salad.

*Note: The noodles and sauce must be at room temperature when tossed and served. If cold, the sauce will lose its creamy consistency.

 To make peanut sauce, combine ginger, garlic, 1 tablespoon green onion, peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, chili paste, sugar, sesame and vegetable oils, sherry, dry mustard, salt and chicken stock. Blend thoroughly. Cover and set aside. Do not refrigerate.

 To make noodles, cook fettuccine until tender. While noodles are still warm, toss with oil until well coated. Chill. Place carrots in sieve and pour boiling water over them. Immediately pat dry with paper towels and chill. Wrap julienned green onions, ham, bean sprouts, cucumber and red pepper separately and chill until serving time. Bring noodles to room temperature before serving. At serving time, place noodles in center of large round bowl or platter. Arrange vegetables and ham attractively in separate mounds around edge. Blend peanut sauce again and pour over noodles, vegetables and ham. Toss.

       3                garlic cloves -- minced
       1      teaspoon  fresh ginger -- minced
       1                scallion -- chopped

In a small bowl; combine soy sauce, chicken broth, sherry, sesame oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, & hot pepper; set aside. In a wok or 12-in. skillet, heat veg. oil until very hot but not smoking. In 2 batches, fry green beans over high heat, turning often with kitchen tongs, until bright green & just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer beans to paper towels to drain. Discard oil remaining in wok.

 Reduce heat to medium. Add pork, garlic, & ginger & cook, stirring to break up lumps of meat, until pork loses its pink color, about 3 minutes. Add green beans & stir-fry 1 minute longer. Stir in reserved sauce & cook until liquid is almost evaropated, about 1 minute. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle scallion over top.

 This recipe also works well if you use 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a nonstick wok or pan.

       1    tablespoon  sesame seed oil

1.Wash string beans.  Cut off ends and string.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Dry on paper towel.

 2.Heat oil until smoking hot; slide in string beans gently. Deep fry beans until wrinkled, about 5 min. Turn frequently. Drain. Remove.

 3.Reheat 2 Tbsp oil in wok.  Stir fry ginger for 10 seconds. Add pork. tir fry until color changes.  Add preserved vegetable. Add beans, salt, soy sauce, sugar, and stock. Stir fry 2 minutes or until dry. Add last 3 ingredients. Stir fry for 1 minute or until thoroughly heated.

 Serve hot or cold  You can find the preserved vegeable in the canned food section of most Asian groceries.  I find that stir frying >> the string beans in a little bit of oil works as well as deep frying them in 2 cups of oil.

   3 1/2   tablespoons  soy sauce
       2   tablespoons  rice vinegar
       2   tablespoons  granulated sugar (or to -- taste)
       1      teaspoon  hot chili oil (or to taste)
       6                green onions -- sliced finely
                        on            the bias -- divided
                        black sesame seeds -- optional
                        fresh cilantro -- oprional
     1/4           cup  bbq pork -- optional

Bring a generous amount of unsalted water to a boil. Add the noodles (all at once) for approximately 2 minutes, or until al dente (toothy but firm). Use chopsticks or two wooden spoons to separate noodles as they cook. Do not overcook.

 Empty noodles into a large colander, then immediately flush with cold running water until cool.  Shake off excess water and drain for 15 to 30 minutes.

 Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and chili oil; mix well. Pour over noodles and use your hands to evenly distribute seasoned sauce. Work carefully so noodles don[t break.  Gently spread sauce over each strand and allow the noodles to fully absorb sauce before eating.

 Add all onions except 2 tablespoons.  Toss and mix to evenly distribute the onions.  Garnish with remaining onions, sesame seeds and cilantro, if desired.

 Noodles taste best if they are allowed to sit and the flavors meld for a few hours before serving.

 Serve refrigerated and cold, or at room temperature.

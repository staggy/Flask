Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. (Do in food processor?)  Combine orange juice and peel with beaten egg. Pour all at once into dry ingredients, mixing just until dampened. Carefully fold in nuts and cranberries.  (If frozen cranberries are used, put through food chopper in frozen state) Spoon into greased loaf pan (9x5x3) .  Spread corners and sides slightly higher than center. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 1 hour, until crust is golden brown and toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove from pan and cool. Store overnight for easier slicing.

This is the original Ocean Spray recipe and is delicious. I sometimes add a coupe of tablespoons of chopped dried apricots to this.

                        Boiling water
                        Sweet milk

 Sift meal, add salt, and mix well.

 Scald meal with just enough boiling water to barely moisten meal and hold  it together.

 Add sufficient milk to make a very thick batter.

 Shape into cakes or pones.

 Place in a well-greased pan and bake for 30 minutes with oven at 450 degrees.

VARIATIONS

Crackling Bread:  Add 1/2 cup crackling broken into bits.  Form two large pones for baking, and serve broken into smaller pieces.

Hush Puppies:  Make corn pones into cakes (1 1/2" x 2" x 1") and fry in hot fat one-half inch deep in pan, until golden brown.  One-half cup of chopped onion added to the recipe adds an interesting flavor.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/2          cups  yellow corn meal
       1      teaspoon  salt

       2   tablespoons  granulated sugar
       2   tablespoons  all-purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
       1                Egg -- beaten
       2          cups  buttermilk
   1 1/2          cups  cooking oil -- about

 Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up on spoon.  If it is too soft, add more cornmeal.

 Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls into 350 degree fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook on second side 1 minute.  Allow oil to heat a few seconds after removing a batch.

 Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however hush puppies freeze well.  When ready to serve frozen hush puppies; place on oven rack in heat until very hot and crisp.

Makes about 48 hush puppies 2" round.

HINTS ON FRYING:   Using a small diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum of oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan  with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350 degrees will cook three hush puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes.  When batter consistency is correct and oil is at 350 degrees, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes almost as soon as they enter the hot oil.  If they are cooked in oil that is too hot, they will not cook in the center.

NOTES : \the cornbread itself is also a little different.  Lynne stirs in several tablespoons of sugar, some dillweed and cream-style corn.  After pouring the batter into an 8-inch square pan, she add the creamy onion topping, and then bakes.  These rich squares of Onion-tooped Cornbread will make a substantial meal when served with soup or vegetables.

       2                egg whites (opt)

Grease and flour a 9x5 loaf pan for each loaf of bread you are making. Combine sugar, milk, butter, and eggs; mix well. Blend in flour, baking powder, salt and grated lemon rind. Turn mixture into pan and bake 1 hour in preheated 350~ oven. Cool slightly, remove from pan, and set on foil. Meanwhile, prepare glaze. Combine sugar and lemon juice in sauce pan. Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves and glaze is hot. Pour hot glaze slowly over surface of bread. Let bread cool completely before slicing. To prepare Lemon Ice, combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Add rind and bring to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes. Let cool. Add lemon juice and stir. Pour liquid into freezer trays (two for each loaf of bread) and freeze until set, but not hard. Place in food processor or blender. If desired, add egg whites (they will make the ice smooth and white), and beat until smooth. Refreeze for about 3 hours or until firm. When ready to serve, let stand for a few minutes before scooping out. Serve bread slices with a scoop of lemon ice on the side.

   1 1/2           cup  milk

Mix the ingredients together: Heat cooking oil in a deep fryer or skillet until very hot. Put batter into a funnel (be sure to cover the spout with one finger), then, holding the funnel over the hot oil ( use extreme caution when cooking with hot oil), release some of the batter in circular motions to form one funnel cake.  The funnel cake will rise quickly and expand, so be careful about how much batter you use for the first one until you get the "feel" for cooking it. Cook to a light golden brown on both sides, then remove from the oil and place on paper towels to drain.. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve while still warm!

                     Corn Bread

Recipe By     : Jewel Sharp
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          cups  self-rising white cornmeal -- yellow or white
       2   tablespoons  self-rising flour
       1                egg
                        fresh buttermilk
                        vegetable oil

Put enough vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet (8 inch skillet for this recipe) to coat the bottom.  Place the pan into the oven and turn it on to 200C (400F).

Mix all ingredients together except the oil, adding enough buttermilk to make the batter thick but easily pourable.  When the oven has heated to 200C (400F), pour the batter into the heated skillet and bake until brown (about 30-40 minutes).  Be careful!  The skillet and oil are very hot.

This recipe takes lots of practice and experimentation to get right, just keep practicing.  Sometimes I like to put niblet corn in the batter.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  self-rising flour

       1           can  beer -- at room temperature
       1                egg -- beat w/ 1 tb water

Combine flour and sugar, pour in beer and stir just until dry ingreds. are moist (about 17 times according to original recipe). Pour batter into greased & floured loaf pan and let sit for about 15 min. to rise. Dough will be very gooey.  Brush top with egg mixture and bake in pre-heated 375 oven for about an hour or until pick comes out clean. When done, brush top with butter.

I like to add things like 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese and 2 tblsp. caraway seeds or the cheese and some fresh chopped jalapenos or just use your imagination.  If you add these things, add them to the flour and mix well before you add the beer.

                     Apricot Nut Bread

Recipe By     : The Best of Electric Crockery Cooking
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  dried apricots
       1           cup  flour
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  sugar
     3/4           cup  milk
       1                egg -- slightly beaten
       1    tablespoon  orange peel -- grated
       1    tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  whole-grain wheat flour
       1           cup  walnuts -- coarsely chopped

Instructions: ------------- Place the apricots on a chopping block.  Sprinkle 1 T flour over them. Dip a knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely.  Flour the knife often to keep the cut up fruit from sticking together.  Sift the remaining flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl. Combine the milk, egg, orange peel, and oil.  Stir the flour mixture and the whole wheat flour.  Fold in the cut up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block and the walnuts.  Pour into a well greased, floured baking unit.  Cover and place on a rack in the slow cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape.  Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours.  Cool on a rack for 10 minutes.  Serve warm or cold. Now before you all ask what a baking unit is (I wondered as I sat and typed this in), I looked it up in the front of the bread section. She says that some manufacturers are making units for slow cookers, but if you don't have one, a 2 pound coffee can works.  Pyrex muffin cups also work. Also 1, 1 1/2 and 2 quart molds work.

Do not lift the lid while baking this bread.

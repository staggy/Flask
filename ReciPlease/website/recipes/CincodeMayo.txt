  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1           can  Sweetened condensed milk
       1           cup  Milk
       3                Eggs
       3                Egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  Almond extract
       1      teaspoon  Vanilla extract

In a small saucepan melt sugar over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. 
Heat oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will fall as a liquid sauce over the custard.

     1/2             c  Onion -- chopped small
       3        Cloves  garlic -- minced
       1                Green pepper -- chopped small
       1            tb  Chili powder
       2            ts  Cumin
     1/2             t  Garlic salt
     1/2             c  Tomato puree
       1          Dash  cayenne
       2             c  Masa harina
       1             t  Salt
       2            tb  Margarine or oil

   Soak the dried corn husks in cold water for 1 hour.


 For the filling, soak the TVP in 7/8 c. hot water for
  5 minutes. 

Saute the olive oil, onion, garlic and
  green pepper in a skillet.


Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, tomato
  puree and cayenne to the reconstituted TVP. 

Mix TVP
  and onions and heat together for 2 minutes.

Taste the
  filling and add a little hot sauce, if desired.
  


To make the masa dough, place the masa harina and
  salt into a bowl. Slowly add enough warm water (about
  1 1/2 cups) to make a firm but moist dough, working in
  the margarine or oil as you knead the mixture.

To form the tamales, use the palm of your hand to
  slap-pat the masa dough into flat patties a
  quarter-inch thick.

Fold patty around a spoonful of
  filling and place in a drained corn husk. Fold the
  husk over to enclose the filling. If husks are small
  or broken, use several pieces. 

Place 1 cup hot water
  in thebottom of a kettle, place a steamer rack in the
  kettle and stack tamales on rack. Cover pan, bring
  water to a boil, reduce heat and steam tamales 45
  minutes.

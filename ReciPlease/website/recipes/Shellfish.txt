      16        ounces  (2) frozen lobster tails
     1/2           cup  water

       1          dash  ground ginger
       1          dash  paprika

Place frozen lobster tails in a shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, covered, on 30% power for 7 to 8 minutes or till thawed, rotating dish a quarter-turn once.  The tails are thawed when the shells are flexible enough to bend.  Using a heavy knife, cut through the center of the top shells.  Continue cutting through meat but not through undershells. Spread the tails open, butterfly style, so meat is on top.  Return to shallow baking dish.  Pour water atop.  Micro-cook, covered, on 50% power for 6 to 8 minutes or just till meat is opaque, rotating dish a quarter-turn every minute.  (Shield cooked meat with small pieces of foil, if necessary, to prevent overcooking.)  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine butter or margarine, lemon juice, orange peel, salt, ginger and paprika.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes or till butter is melted.  Mix well.  Drizzle lobster tails with butter mixture.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         large  eggplant
       1          pint  fresh raw oysters
     1/2        medium  white onion -- chopped
     1/4         pound  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
       1           jar  pimientos -- (2 oz.)
       2                Eggs
                        Salt
     1/4         pound  butter
       1           Rib  celery -- chopped
       2        slices  whole wheat bread
       1       Handful  fresh parsley

 First:  slice top off eggplant length-wise (that means laying it on  its side - not the stem).  Scoop out pulp from large piece and set pulp aside for use later.  Sprinkle inside of eggplant with salt, replace its hat and refrigerate in a Pyrex baking dish until time to stuff,

 Second:  preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Place two slices of whole wheat bread in oven to dry out while it is heating.

 Third:  melt butter in heavy skillet over medium heat.  Braise with the lid on the following chopped items until soft:  cubed eggplant pulp, sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped celery, and onion.  You know already to wash it all well in cold water to avoid grit in the food.

 Fourth:  add drained oysters, pimientos, dried-out bread which you have pulled into small pieces, and parsley to the above.  Have you discovered how mush easier it is to cut parsley with kitchen shears than with a knife?  Stir.

 Fifth:  beat eggs until lemon-colored and add to the above.  Turn fire to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes by the clock, stirring constantly.  Remove from fire and salt to taste.

 Sixth:  stuff eggplant.  At this point, you can put the whole business in the refrigerator, covered of course, and wait until an hour before serving time to take it out.

 Seventh:  pour 1/4 inch water into the bottom of the baking dish.  Make a foil tent which will seal the eggplant in the dish but not mash on the top of it.  Place in preheated 300 degree oven and bake 45 minutes.  Don't overcook this one.  The eggplant will collapse.  I learned this through bitter experience.

Mix the first five ingredients in a medium bowl to blend. Let the batter stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Mix the crabmeat, bread crumbs, two of the egg whites and the parsley in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.  Divide the mixture into 24 mounds. press each mound firmly into a ball.  Roll each crabmeat ball in flour; shake off excess. Immediately before frying, beat the remaining egg whites in a small bowl to stiff peaks.  Fold the egg whites into the batter. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy saucepan to 360F. Dip the crab balls, one at a time, into the batter, coating completely. Carefully lower into the oil. Repeat with the remaining crab balls, cooking until pale and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fritters to paper towels and drain. Serve with Curry Sauce. Do not overcrowd the fryer or saucepan when making these crab fritters.

                     Venezuelan Peppers With Shrimp

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3        pounds  shrimp (16-20/lb)
       3          cups  olive oil
       4         large  red bell peppers
       8        cloves  garlic
       1                chili pepper seeded/minced
       1          loaf  french bread 1" slices
                        feta cheese (optional)

Bell peppers should be seeded and cut into thin julienne strips. Garlic cloves should be peeled and cut into 1/4-inch chunks.

Slit the shrimp up the back with a sharp knife.  Remove the vein, but do not peel shrimp.  Set them aside.  Combine 2 cups of olive oil and the red pepper strips in a deep heavy skillet or saute pan.  Heat slowly. Cook very gently until the peppers are extremely tender but not at all browned.  (The oil will turn a lovely rose color.)  Set peppers aside. Pour the remaining oil into another skillet with the garlic pieces.  Stew the garlic slowly for 4 to 5 minutes, until tender and golden.  Scoop out the garlic with a strainer or slotted spoon and add it to the peppers. Heat the garlic oil until it ripples. Throw in the minced chili pepper and the shrimp.  Saute, tossing the shrimp in the oil, until they turn pink and are just done.  To serve, spoon the peppers and their oil into a serving dish.  Surround with the shrimp.  Serve with bread.  Each diner soaks slices of bread in the oil and piles the bread with peppers and garlic.  Feta cheese may be eaten with it and the shrimp goes on top.

*Poo Jah DIRECTIONS: Combine crab meat, pork, shrimps, garlic, pepper, cilantro roots, and Golden Mount sauce well. Stuff in each crab shell and pack tightly. Sprinkle cilantro leaves and red chilies. Smooth the surface and press down securely. Bring a lot of water to a rapid boil in a steamer. Arrange in the stuffed crab shells. Place several layers of paper towels on top of the steamer, NOT the food and replace the cover. Steam for 20 minutes and remove from heat. Cool. Beat the egg in a small bowl. In a large wok, heat lots of oil over medium-high heat. Dip the stuffed crab in the egg and fry meat side down until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain well. Cool slightly and serve immediately. Serve with Thai Sriracha chili sauce as an appetizer. Makes 4 servings. NOTE: Do not fry the crab too long as the stuffing will shrink and fall out of the shell.

       1                tempura sauce recipe

Make several crosswise slits on the underside of shrimp to prevent curling.  Parboil green beans.  Pat shrimp and vegetables dry; arrange on platter; cover and refrigerate until serving time. Prepare batter and sauce recipes.  Do not make batter recipe too far ahead of time. Heat oil in a wok to 360 degrees.  Dip shrimp and vegetables into batter with tongs; allow excess batter to drip into bowl. Fry a few pieces at a time until golden brown, turning once (cooking time approximately 2-3 minutes).     This is best prepared close to or at the table. It is great fun to have a "tempura party" with guests cooking their own. Serve with sauce and rice. (you may need more batter mix depending on the amounts of seafood and vegetables you prepare).  Does not keep well once cooked.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4         large  leeks -- white part only
       1         stick  sweet butter
     1/2           cup  dry white wine -- salt and pepper to t
       2          cups  lobster stock
       1           cup  creme fraiche(*recipe next)
       1           cup  heavy cream -- reduced by half
       3        pounds  slipper lobster tails
                        beurre manie (**recipe next)

Wash leeks very well under cold, running water.  Cut into bite-size strips, about 1/4" wide.  Heat large skillet, add 4 Tblsp butter, when melted add leeks and wine. Cover and cook on low heat for about 6 minutes, or until leeks are almost tender. Uncover and finish cooking and there is no liquid left in the skillet. Remove from heat & set aside. Reduce the lobster stock or clam juice by half, on high heat.  Whisk in the Creme Fraiche and return the mixture to heat and reduce to about 1 cup--about 15 minutes, whisking constantly.  Whisk in the reduced heavy cream and reduce the entire mixture until it is very thick.  If the sauce isn't thick enough to your taste, add the Beurre Maine, 1 Tblsp at a time until a satisfactory consistency is reached.  Add the leeks to the sauce, but don't wash the skillet. Stir to combine well and set aside. Heat the skilled and when hot, add 4 Tblsp butter.  When melted add lobster tails. Mix frequently for about 5 or 6 minutes so the lobster is just about cooked. Don't overcook the lobster or it will be tough and horrible. Return the leek sauce to the skillet. Stir well and heat through over medium heat.

 Meanwhile, soak pointed wooden skewers in cold water (to keep then from burning).  Cut bacon in half crosswise; drop then in water and blanch (boil slowly) for 5 minutes, then drain, rinse and dry them.

 Skewing.  Push the sharp end of a skewer through one end of a piece of bacon, then the large end of a shrimp, the middle part of a bacon strip, the tail of the shrimp and bacon end.  Keep in plastic on ice until cooking.

 Barbecuing or broiling.  Barbecue bacon-side down first, then bacon-side up a minute or so on each side.  Or Broil bacon-side up first, then bacon-side down - a minute or so on each side close under the hot broiler element.  Serve at once.

                        ***None***

By Julia Child

Shrimp are exceptionally perishable, and because of this, many packers use a chemical called tripolyphosphate to keep them firm and white.  But when they use too much, the shrimp take on an unpleasant cleaning-fluid odor and taste.  Read the package label!

When buying frozen shrimp, you will have the best luck, I think, if you choose them raw in the shell.  

If your market has thawed the shrimp, give your purchase a serious sniff before leaving the premises; keep them on ice, and use them at once.  Top-quality frozen shrimp (and we've had some that were excellent) should not only smell sweet and fresh, they should also be beautifully tender to eat, especially when broiled with bacon.

(You can also do this on individual plates) Top with some of the sauce and then some of the shrimp.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      48                fresh shrimp (2 lbs)
       8        ounces  cream cheese
       8        ounces  blue cheese
       8        ounces  sour cream
       2   tablespoons  garlic -- finely chopped
       4   tablespoons  parsley -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  sauterne wine
       6                lemon wedges
       6                alum foil pieces 12/12"

Cook, peel & clean shrimp & let cool.  Blend together the cheeses & sour cream, being careful to get a smooth and even mixture. Cheese sauce will be thin. Add the chopped garlic & parsley & mix well.  Add the wine. (A bit more or less wine may be required to get the desired thickness of the mixture.) Place about 4 oz. of the mixture on a piece of the foil; add 8 shrimp (or more if you want) and top with a piece of lemon. Fold over 2 sides of foil, then ends, so a tight package is formed to prevent leaking. (You could use ramekins in place of foil) Bake in oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.

Rinse and peel the shrimp; refrigerate until needed. Use shells and heads to make the shrimp stock.  In a large skillet melt 1 stick butter over high heat. When almost melted, add the green onions, salt, garlic, ground peppers, basil, thyme and oregano; stir well. Add the shrimp and saute just until they turn pink, about 1 minute, shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a back and forth motion. Add the mushrooms and 1/4 cup stock; add the remaining 4 Tbsp butter in chunks and continue cooking, continuing to shake the pan.  Before the butter chunks are completely melted, add the parsley then the remaining 2 Tbsp stock; continue cooking and shaking the pan until all ingredients are mixed thoroughly and butter sauce is the consistency of cream. Serve immediately in a bowl with lots of French bread on this side, or serve over pasta or rice.

       1           cup  finely chopped scallions
     1/2           cup  finely chopped celery
     1/2           cup  finely chopped parsley
       1                garlic clove -- finely minced
       1  2 ounces can  anchovies -- drained
       8   tablespoons  butter

     1/2           cup  heavy cream
       1          dash  tabasco sauce to taste
       2   tablespoons  Pernod or Ricard**
     1/3           cup  grated parmesan cheese

*2 (10 oz.) packages of fresh spinach can be substituted. **Other anise-flavored liqueur can be substituted. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Open the oysters, leaving them on the half shell and reserving the oyster liquid. Pick over the spinach and remove any tough stems and blemished leaves. Rinse well and put in a saucepan. Cover and cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted. Cook briefly and drain well. Squeeze to remove excess moisture.  Blend or put through a food grinder. There should be about 2 cups. Put the scallions, celery and parsley into the container of a food processor or an electric blender and blend. There should be about a cup finely blended. Chop the garlic and anchovies together finely. Heat 4 Tbsp. butter in a skillet and add the scallion and celery mixture.  Stir about 1 minute and add the anchovy mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 1 minute and add the spinach. Stir to blend. Heat the remaining 4 Tbsp. butter in a saucepan and add the flour. Blend, stirring with a wire whisk, and add the oyster liquid, stirring vigorously with the whisk. Stir in the cream. Season with Tabasco. Do not add salt.  Add the spinach mixture and Pernod. Let cool. Spoon equal amounts of the mixture on top of the oysters and smooth over the tops.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until piping hot. NOTE: The same spinach topping is equally good (some think it is better) with clams on the half shell

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1    tablespoon  cayenne pepper
   2 1/4     teaspoons  paprika -- sweet
   1 1/2     teaspoons  pepper -- black
   1 1/4     teaspoons  garlic powder
     3/4      teaspoon  onion powder
     3/4      teaspoon  thyme -- dried
     3/4      teaspoon  oregano -- dried
                        -----shrimp coating-----
       2                eggs
   1 3/4          cups  flour; all purpose -- in all
     3/4           cup  beer -- fresh
       1    tablespoon  baking powder
      48                shrimp; medium -- peeled (but
                        tails on)& deveined
       3          cups  coconut; grated -- about 6 oz.
                        -----sweet & tangy dipping sauce-----
   1 2/3          cups  orange marmalade -- an 18 oz.
       5   tablespoons  mustard -- creole or brown
       5   tablespoons  horseradish -- finally grated

Combine all ingredients of the Sweet and Tangy Dipping Sauce and refrigerate. Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. In a separate bowl combine 2 ts of the mix with the eggs, 1 1/4 c of the flour, the beer and baking powder; mix well, breaking up any lumps. In a separate small bowl combine the remaining 1/2 c flour with 1 1/2 ts of the seasoning mix; set aside. Place the coconut in a separate bowl. Sprinkle both sides of the shrimp with the remaining seasoning mix. Then, holding the shrimp by the tail, dredge each in the flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dip in batter (except tail), allowing excess to drip off, and then coat generously with grated coconut and place on a baking sheet. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degree F. Drop shrimp, one at a time, into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side. Do not crowd. (You may want to cut the first shrimp in half after frying to best estimate frying time; the batter should be cooked through but the shrimp not overcooked.) Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with Sweet and Tangy Dipping Sauce.

     1/3           cup  unsalted butter

       1                garlic clove -- minced
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1                poblano chili
       1         pound  fresh cooked lump crab meat
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
      12       10 inch  flour tortillas
   1 1/2          cups  grated jalapeno jack cheese
                        salsa

Place the butter and oil in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat until the butter is melted. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a small cup and add the garlic and onion to the pan. Saute over medium-high heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chili, crab, mayonnaise, salt, and cilantro. Mix well. To soften the tortillas, place them on a heated grill or skillet for about 15 seconds on one side, then turn. Brush one side with the butter-oil mixture, turn the tortilla over and spread the crab mixture on one half of the tortilla, and top with a tablespoon of grated cheese. Repeat until all the tortillas are filled. At this point, the quesadillas can either be sauteed or finished in the oven. If sauteing, heat a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes on a side, or until golden brown. Or preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake on a cookie sheet until the tops are golden , about 5 minutes. Cut into quarters and serve.

Return to the boil and cook until thickened. Remove pan from heat and stir in the egg; fuss with the mixture so the egg becomes thin filaments rather than a big glob in the middle of the pan.

Stir in the cooked shrimp and toss with the sauce. Serve immediately.

       8        slices  Bread -- crusts removed
                        Oil -- for deep frying

Dice onion, water chestnuts, and shrimp together. Mince until fine. Place in small bowl. Add egg, salt, pepper, and corn starch. Mix thoroughly. Spread in a thin layer on slices of bread. 

Pour oil into a wok, halfway up. Turn heat on to highest point. When you think oil is sufficiently heated, take a bread crust and test it to see if it is up to the proper temperature.

If bread crust readily browns to a golden colour then oil is ready. If bread crust fails to brown, then oil is not ready yet.

If bread crust turns to a dark brown, then shut heat off and allow oil to cool at least 5 minutes before turning burner back on. Be sure and retest oil before deep frying shrimp toast.

Place a slice of bread with the shrimp mixture face down in the hot oil and deep fry about 3 minutes until golden brown colour. Turn bread and fry reverse side.

Remove to paper toweling to drain excess oil. Repeat procedure until all slices are done. Cut slices of shrimp toast into strips or triangles. Serve immediately.

                     Aromatic Shrimp Creole

       2        medium  onions -- medium diced
       2  large cloves  garlic -- minced
       4                celery stalks -- medium diced
       2        medium  green bell peppers -- medium diced
       6   tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
       6          cups  chicken stock
                        OR
       6          cups  canned chicken broth
   1 1/2        pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled and deveined
                        Ground black pepper (to taste)
       4          cups  cooked white rice
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley

TO COOK: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add the next 5 ingredients; sauti
until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add next 4 ingredients; saute
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock; bring to boil and cook
over medium-high heat until thickened, about 30 minutes. Add shrimp;
simmer until shrimp are opaque throughout, about 4 minutes. Season with
1/2 teaspoon pepper or to taste.

TO SERVE: Ladle a portion of shrimp creole into each warm soup plate.
Spoon 3/4 cup rice atop each portion of creole. Sprinkle with parsley and
serve immediately.

The Pipers call this dish a "white creole" because it is not thickened
with the traditional mahogany-colored roux. Instead, a mixture of chicken
stock, tomato paste, and aromatic vegetables is reduced until the sauce
becomes quite thick and flavorful. It is best to serve this shrimp creole
with steamed white rice.

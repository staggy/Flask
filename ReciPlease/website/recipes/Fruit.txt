     1/4           cup  brandy
                        granulated sugar for coating apricots

Combine apricots and water. Heat to boiling and simmer 5 minutes. Cool. Drain and measure 1 cup liquid from apricots (add water, if necessary, to make this amount).

Turn 1 cup liquid into a 9" skillet.

Add 1-cup sugar and brandy, and heat to boiling, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add drained apricots, and simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and allow to stand several hours or overnight.

Add remaining 1/2-cup sugar, and boil slowly 5 minutes. Let stand as before.

Cook twice more for 5 minutes each time, allowing apricots to stand in the syrup for several hours or overnight between each cooking. Cool in syrup, then drain well.

Arrange apricots on a wire cake rack and set over a shallow pan, to drain and dry.

To make fruit less sticky, place in an oven with a pilot light for 24 hours, or heat oven and then place in oven to dry.

Coat with sugar.

Immediately pour onto baking sheet and cool completely.  2.  Break cooled nut mixture into pieces. Grind to a powder in a food processor or blender.  3.  Whip cream until it holds soft peaks.  Mix in vanilla and half of ground nut mixture.  4.  To serve, place a spoonful of whipped cream into serving bowls; top with berries and a small sprinkling of nut powder.  Chicago Tribune, 08/05/93.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------

I'm not at all good with desserts. My favorite thing after a big meal is fruit. I know, you`re going to say "how boring!"Just give me a chance. I have some tricks in my apron pocket! I`ll give you just a few ideas now.

 GRAPES...why not run them under cold water, dust with regular sugar and put them in the freezer for an hour? They won`t last long enough on your table to defrost. Try mixing a bowl of different colored grapes.

 PEACHES....Take about 1 peach per person, especially in the winter.(These Chili fruits look great, but their flavor is missing something.) Slice them in wedges, sprinkle with cinnamon, add a tbls of some liqueur, any flavor and cover and cook in the microwave for 5-7 min. Serve as you would applesauce with a pork roast. It`s great with any roast. You can also make a mixture of fruits for this, pear, nectarine,plums...use your imagination. STRAWBERRIES.....The season is coming soon and I want you all prepared for this one. It`s the best. I can`t tell you how much to make for how many people, because no matter how much you make it will NEVER be enough. Wash strawberries well, THEN take off the top or any bruises. (you don`t want to wash away any flavor) cut each one in half or thirds if you must. Place in a large bowl that has a secure cover or a large jar. Add a few tbls sugar and the juice of a fresh lemon or two. Fill your container 2/3 nearly covering berries.Place the cover on and shake gently. Place in  refrig for at least 6 hour turning and shaking every hour or so. You need not serve anything else with this, just make sure to provide juice glasses and a ladle when the berries are done. Then just sit back and relax. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00

                        ***NONE***

 Select moisture-proof containers with lids that are thoroughly clean.

 Work with a small amount of cherries at a time to allow for quick handling and prompt freezing.

 Wash cherries in ice water and drain.  Pack according to preferred method and freeze immediately.

 To freeze whole with stems, pack washed cherries with stems intact in freezer containers.  Shake containers to pack cherries closely.  Cover tightly and freeze.

 For a syrup pack, make a syrup by boiling 1 cup sugar with 2 cups water until sugar dissolves.  Refrigerate until syrup is ice cold.  It takes 1/2 to 2/3 cup syrup for each pint container of cherries.  Add 1/2 Tsp. ascorbic acid per pint of cherries.  Pour about 1/2 cup ice cold syrup into container.  Fill half full with pitted fresh sweet cherries.  Shake container to pack fruit as closely as possible with crushing.  Finish filling container with cherries, leaving 1/2 inch headspace for half pints and pints; 3/4 inch for 1 1/2 pints.  If needed, add more syrup to cover cherries.  Place small pieces of crumpled plastic wrap or aluminum foil on top of fruit, dressing down; to hold cherries under syrup.  Cover tightly and freeze.

 For dry sugar pack, fill freezing containers with pitted or unpitted fresh sweet cherries.  Shake container to pack cherries closely.  Pour 1/3 cup sugar over each pint of cherries.  Cover tightly and freeze.

                        -- stems on

 Combine first 4 ingredients in large, deep saucepan and bring to boil stirring until sugar is dissolved.

 Set pears into boiling syrup and cook covered 8 to 10 minutes, turning fruit occasionally so it is cooked evenly.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  all-purpose flour (3 1/2 to 4 cups)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1       package  Fleischmann's. Active Dry or Rapid Rise
                        Yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  dairy sour cream
     1/4           cup  butter or margarine
       1                egg
     1/2           cup  chopped red candied cherries
                        ALMOND FILLING
     1/2           cup  almond paste (5 ounces)
       1                egg white
     1/2           cup  blanched almonds -- toasted
                        ICING
       1           cup  confectioner's sugar
       2   tablespoons  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract

In large bowl combine 3/4 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt.
Heat water, sour cream and butter until very warm (120: to 130:F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add egg and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. With spoon, stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 4 to 6 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (With Rapid Rise Yeast, cover kneaded dough; let rest on floured surface 10 minutes. Proceed with recipe.)
Prepare Almond Filling: Combine almond paste with 1 egg white. Beat with fork until blended. Stir in chopped, blanched almonds, toasted.
Punch dough down. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 9- W 16-inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2-inch of edges; sprinkle with cherries. Roll up from long side as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Form into ring and pinch ends to seal. Place ring, seam side down, on greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, 3/4 through dough, at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Bake at 375:F for 25 minutes or until done. Remove from baking sheet; cool on wire rack. Frost with Almond Icing.

Roll dough on a lightly-floured board into a large rectangle. Cut into 4" squares. Wrap squares around cannoli tubes so that 2 corners fold over and two corners point outward. Brush the touching corners with egg white so that they will stick together. Deep fry in hot oil until golden. Cool and remove from tubes. Fill. Makes 10 to 12 cannoli. If you don't have cannoli tubes, make 2" diameter tubes out of heavy-duty aluminum foil and fold dough accordingly. FILLING: Combine all ingredients and fill the cannoli.

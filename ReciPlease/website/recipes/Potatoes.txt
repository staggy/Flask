       6         large  onions -- halved and sliced in
                        half moons
   1 1/2   tablespoons  butter
       2          cups  vegetable stock
       2   tablespoons  dry white wine or vermouth
                        salt and pepper to taste

Combine the onions, butter and stock in a heavy, deep skillet. Cover and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat slightly and simmer briskly for 10 minutes. Uncover. Simmer for approximately 35 - 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is almost gone. Cook for a few more minutes, stirring constantly. The onions will begin to stick just a bit. Keep cooking and stirring for a few minutes more, using your wooden spatula to scrape up the browned deposits that form on the bottom of the skillet. Turn the heat up a bit more and let the onions begin to burn. Not scorching - just a little gentle burning and sticking on the bottom of the skillet. Splash in the wine and boil until it is just about evaporated, stirring and scraping up the browned bits vigorously. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Remove from the heat.  Serve at once over mashed potatoes. Well covered it will keep in the refrigerator for days.

       2          cups  grated gruyere cheese
       2         pints  whipping cream

*    Garlic cloves should be peeled and split. **   Potatoes should be peeled and sliced paper-thin.  (Slice at the last minute so that they do not darken; do not soak in cold water).

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Rub the bottom and sides of a gratin dish with the cut sides of the garlic.  Leave the garlic in the dish. Cover with a layer of potatoes.  Sprinkle with some salt and freshly ground pepper and cheese.  Pour some cream over the whole thing.  Repeat until all the potatoes, cream, and cheese are used. Place the pan, uncovered in the oven.  (Put a baking sheet underneath to catch spills.) Bake for 1 hour or more, until the top is browned and the cream has cooked down to a thick sauce.  During the first 1/2 hour of cooking, use a broad spatula to push the top layers of potatoes into the cream every once in a while.  Serve hot, at room temperature or cold.

Mash remaining potato pulp and mix with onion, pepper, meat, half the cheese and a spoon or two of the sour cream. Spoon into each shell, leaving a well in the middle. Divide remaining cheese into the wells and put a pat of butter on top. Chill overnight. Heat at 375 degrees until heated through. Top with sour cream, bacon, and chives and serve with a nice green salad and a crusty bread.

                        -----chips-----
       2                (about 1 lb) idaho -- baking potatoes (2
                        to 3)
       1         quart  to 2 quarts peanut or -- canola oil, for
                        frying
                        -----chip seasoning-----
     1/2      teaspoon  pure red chile powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne chile powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Note: Idaho russet baking potatoes make the best chips, as they are high in moisture and low in sugar.

 1. Peel and slice the potatoes paper-thin with a mandolin or in a food processor. Soak the sliced potatoes in ice-cold water 5 minutes. (You can slice the potatoes ahead of time and hold them in water as long as 4 or 5 hours.) Drain in a salad spinner or lay flat on kitchen towels and pat dry.

 2. Heat the oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, thoroughly combine all the chip seasoning ingredients in a bowl. Fry the potatoes in batches until crisp and brown. Remove with a slotted spoon or use a spoon and strainer, and drain on paper towels.

 3. Transfer to a large bowl and toss chips with chip seasoning while still warm.

 Serving suggestions: For best results, serve immediately. Good with burgers, sandwiches, or with eggs and chorizo for breakfast or brunch. Storage: Can be stored in a cool, dry place two to three days, or up to one week in dry climates.

                     Homemade French Fries

       1         pound  beef fat -- cut in
                        vegetable oil
       1         pound  idaho potatoes
                        salt

Here are the results of Chicago Tribune Test Kitchen experiments to make the best homemade French Fries:

 1.  To render liquid fat from beef fat, cook it in a heavy saucepan over low heat, about 40 minutes or more. Discard pieces of fat which are left over.  Add an equal part of vegetable oil to beef fat in pan.

 2.  Cut unpeeled potatoes into long strips about  1/4- 3/8-inch wide. Soak in a large bowl of ice water for about 45 minutes. Arrange on paper towels and carefully pat dry.

 3.  Heat oil mixture to 365 degrees.  Add potatoes in batches so pan isn't crowded.  Fry until they begin to look partially cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove and let oil return to 365 degrees. Return partially cooked fries and continue cooking until they are crisp and golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel to drain. Sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.

 NOTES FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE TEST KITCHEN:  When we asked where to find the best french fries, no one suggested homemade ones, which start with fresh potatoes instead of a bag of frozen sticks. Making french fries from scratch is a mighty effort, raising the question of whether the end justifies the means, so the Tribune test kitchen endeavored to find an answer.

 With no apologies to nutritionists, we decided to follow the conventional wisdom that beef fat is the best way to make good-tasting fries and to try using less saturated vegetable oil. We got beef fat from the butcher, a big bag of Idaho spuds and a bottle of vegetable oil to do some experimenting.

 Some basic tenets we accepted as truth: The potatoes would be cut by hand with the peels on. They would be  soaked in ice water for 45 minutes. They would be painstakingly patted dry. They would be fried twice.  The wild cards: What's the best oil to use? Is it  worth all the effort? Beef fat won hands down-no contest.  Beef fat fries were crisp and delicate. They were not greasy and had a subtle taste. People said it smelled as if we were cooking Christmas dinner, which we took to mean they were used to standing rib roast for Christmas, not french fries. Those fries were gobbled up. On the

   1 1/2          cups  stock

Preheat the oven to 400. Peel the garlic and split it. Rub the sides of the gratin pan with the garlic and leave it in the pan. Slice the potato paper-thin.  Do not soak them in water at any time. Layer 1/3 of the potato slices in the gratin dish and sprinkle evenly with the cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Pour 1/3 of the stock over. Repeat two times. Press the top with a spatula to press the top layer into the liquid. Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until the potatoes are tender, the liquid has cooked down to a thick sauce, and the top is brown and crusty.

Peel potatoes and place in large spoon.  Slice downwards at 1/4-inch intervals. The spoon will prevent cutting all the way through the potato. As you work, put potatoes in cold, salted water.

 Drain potatoes and pat dry.  Put potatoes, cut-side up, in large buttered baking dish. Baste with butter. Sprinkle with salt. Bake 30 minutes in 425-degree oven.

 Baste with remaining butter and sprinkle crumbs over each potato. Bake 15 minutes longer or until golden and tender. Add cheese five minutes before potatoes are done.

                     Mashed Potato Gratin With Garlic And Onions

Recipe By     :

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4         large  idaho potatoes
       2         large  garlic heads -- roasted
       2         large  onions -- baked
   1 1/4          cups  heavy cream
                        salt and pepper to taste
       1           cup  gruyere

Remove the papery covering of the garlic heads, but do not peel and do not separate the cloves.  Wrap well in foil and put them in the oven. Put the onions on a double sheet of foil, but do not wrap them; put them in the oven. Pierce the potatoes in several places with a thin skewer or the tines of a fork.  Put them directly on the oven rack. Bake the garlic for one hour and the onions and the potatoes for an hour and a half at 425. After an hour pull out the garlic heads, unwrap, and let cool for 5 minutes. Separate the cloves and squeeze them over a bowl so the softened garlic pops out into the bowl. After 1 1/4  hours, pull out the onions and potatoes.  If the onions are not very soft (almost collapsed) put them back in for a few minutes. Perforate the potatoes lengthwise and crosswise with the tines of a fork and squeeze.  Scoop the potato flesh into a bowl and mash it with a potato masher. With a sharp knife, cut off the stem and root ends of the onions.  Remove the skin and the first layer. Put the oni ons in a food processor and puree. Combine the potatoes, garlic, onion, 1/4 cup of cream, and salt and pepper in the bowl of a mixer. Beat (with the paddle blade) until smooth and blended, then scrape the mixture into a large gratin bowl.  Sprinkle the top with cheese. (The recipe can be made ahead to this point and kept in the refrigerator, covered, for a day or so. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350. Pour the remaining cream over the mixture.  Bake, uncovered, for 40 - 50 minutes, or until the top is browned and bubbly and the cream has cooked down to a very thick suace-like consistency. Try to arrange to have some leftovers; this is very good when it is cold.

       4          tbsp  olive oil
       1          tbsp  wine vinegar
       2                garlic cloves -- crushed
       1            sm  red pepper
       1          tbsp  chives -- chopped

Scrape the potatoes (I don't).  Cook until tender, but do not overcook them or they will break up.

 Mix together the oil & vinegar.  Toss the potatoes while still hot. Stir in the garlic & red pepper.  Sprinkle with the chopped chives. Serve while still warm.

 **Mark's note: This potato salad is a refreshing change from other potato salads. I found it was actually very good even after it had gone cold, though I did always serve it at room temperature rather than chilled.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       8        medium  baking potatoes
                        salt
     1/2           cup  feta cheese -- crumbled
       2                eggs
       3   tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        salsa

Boil the potatoes for 15 minutes or until well cooked; drain, when cool enough to handle, but not cold, peel them. In a large bowl, mash them, add salt to taste and mix thoroughly. Set aside. Using a blender, coarsely chop the cheese. Combine the potatoes and cheese, mixing well, using your fingers.  Add eggs and continue mixing by hand until the mixture is smooth. Taste and add salt if necessary. Heat some of the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Scoop out a little bit of the potato mixture (about 2 tablespoons) and pat out a small cake with your fingers, flipping it gently from hand to hand until it is a uniform shape, about 3 inches in diameter and about 1/2 inch thick. Place the potato cake in the hot oil and saute for about 3-4 minutes.  Remove from the pan and drain it on a paper towel. After patting out each cake, dip your fingers in a bowl of water so the next one will not stick and add some oil to the frying pan after each batch. Stack the drained potato cakes on a platter in a warm oven until ready to serve. (To store, wrap them in foil and refrigerate. Reheat by placing the foil package in a moderate over for 15 - 20 minutes. They are not crisp on the outside when reheated, but still tasty)  Serve with salsa.

Preheat the oven to 400. Separate the head of garlic into cloves and peel. Scatter the cloves and the onion slices on the bottom of a baking dish that will hold the potatoes in a single layer. Place the halved potatoes, cut side down, on the bed of garlic and onions. Pour in enough stock to come about one quarter of the way up the sides of the dish. Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over all, then dot with butter. Bake, uncovered, for one hour, or until the potatoes are tender, the onions beginning to brown and the liquid about gone.  Serve piping hot.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
      12         small  new white potatoes -- about 2 1/4 lb total
       3   tablespoons  light-tasting olive oil
   1 1/2   tablespoons  Hungarian paprika
     3/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     3/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
       1      teaspoon  salt

1.  Put rack in center of oven; heat oven to 400 degrees. Have ready foil-lined baking pan, large enough to hold potatoes in a single layer.

 2.  Put potatoes in plastic food bag.  In small dish, combine remaining ingredients.  Add mixture to potatoes. Shake bag to coat potatoes. Transfer potatoes in a single layer to prepared baking sheet. Drizzle any remaining oil and spices over potatoes.

 3.  Bake until just barely tender (but still firm), 25 to 30 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.  Turn a few times during baking. Can be baked several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.

 4.  To serve, sprinkle with salt and place over hot barbecue fire until seared and hot, just a few minutes, turning often. Serve hot.

 These potatoes are "red hot" from the paprika, chili powder and cayenne pepper.  Omit the pepper if you prefer a milder taste. These potatoes can be roasted several hours ahead and kept at room temperature before grilling at dinner time.

 Serve the potatoes with roasted chicken and asparagus.

       4                green onions -- minced
                        paprika for garnish

Preheat the oven to 425.  Wash and dry the potatoes, then pierce a few times with a fork.  Place on an oven rack and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until very soft. Remove from the oven; preheat the broiler. Let potatoes cool slightly, then cut a wedge equal to a third of the potato from the top of each, being carful not to break the skin of the rest of the potato. Remove enough of the interior to leave a 1/2 inch thickness of potato inside the skin, and mash in a bowl with yogurt, blue cheese, and green onions. Spoon back into potato shells, mounding over the top. Sprinkle each with paprika.  Broil for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

 You can add chopped cooked vegetables to the yogurt/cheese to make a more filling dish.

Toss and cook 1 minute more. Add stock. Bring to boil, stirring several times to prevent potatoes from sticking to pan. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are quite tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

 Remove soup from heat and puree, using food processor, blender or food mill. Return mixture to pan and stir in half and half. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Soup can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cool, cover and refrigerate.)  To serve soup warm, reheat over medium heat, stirring, until hot. To serve cold, taste chilled soup once again and add salt and pepper if needed. (Cold foods often require extra seasonings.)  Ladle into 8 bowls and garnish each with 1/2 teaspoon chopped cilantro. Makes 8 servings.

                     New Potatoes With Green/Gold Topping

Recipe By     :

Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       8        ounces  new potatoes; (small -- tender-skinned)
                        boiling water to cover
       2     teaspoons  mayonnaise or slaw dressing
       3      handfuls  fresh -- spinach leaves; coar
                        (3 to 4)
                        stems removed
       4                green onions -- sliced
                        with tops
       4                eggs
       2     teaspoons  to 3 ts dijonnaise -- (or 1 part
                        mayo mixed with 2 parts -- dijon mustard)
                        salt to taste
       6        ounces  monterey jack cheese -- shredded

Boil potatoes until tender.  Rinse saucepan and return to moderate heat; add 2 teaspoons mayonnaise or bottled slaw dressing to melt in pan. Meanwhile, rinse spinach and tear each leaf into three or four pieces. With a bit of water clinging to the spinach leaves, add to mayo in saucepan. Cook uncovered, along with the green onions, until barely wilted. Stir often. Break the eggs over the spinach-onion mixture and stir slightly to scramble as the eggs set.

 To serve, use a fork to break open each hot potato and mash to form a solid 'bed' on each plate.  Salt potato layer lightly and dot with Dijonnaise; spread to distribute evenly. Sprinkle with a little shredded Monterey Jack. Top with scrambled spinach-egg-onion mixture in an even layer. Salt lightly, if desired. Sprinkle remaining shredded cheese on top. Serve hot.

 NUTRITION ANALYSIS: 1 serving has 638 calories, 31.4 g fat, 508 mg cholesterol. To reduce fat and cholesterol, use egg substitute instead of whole eggs; buy a skim-milk mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack cheese, and use less in the topping. If sodium is a concern, this is still tasty without any table salt.

Boil the potatoes until tender. Heat 1/2 T butter in a skillet and cook the leeks for 5 - 7 minutes, until tender and golden. Set aside. In a large skillet, over moderate heat, cook the mushrooms in the remaining tablespoon of butter until they begin to render their juices. Turn up the heat and continue cooking until they are almost dry. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350. When the potatoes are tender, drain, peel, and return them to the pot. Toss over low heat to dry, then put them through a ricer into a mixer bowl.  Beat in the softened butter, buttermilk, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread half the potatoes on the bottom of a shallow baking dish.  Spread the mushrooms over the potatoes and the leeks over the mushrooms.  Spread with 1 cup of sour cream and cover with the remaining potatoes. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until browned and bubbling.

       4        ounces  butter
       1          Dash  salt

Sweat the onions in melted butter until slightly browned. Peel and wash potatoes, slice thinly in the shape of the cocotte (a small cup-shaped baking dish). Rub cocotte with whole butter and garlic clove. Alternate layers of potato and sautied onions, seasoning each one until cocotte is full.

STEP TWO: Preparing the Custard Royale--
Combine 4 eggs, 8 ounces heavy cream, salt, and white pepper and pour over cocottes, pressing gently on potatoes to remove any air that may be trapped.

STEP THREE: 
Bake in preheated oven at 325 degrees F for approximately 45 minutes or until potatoes are tender and custard is set. Let sit 5 minutes before removing from cocotte.

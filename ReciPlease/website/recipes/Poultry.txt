--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2                Chicken, Whole -- broiler/fryer
       3   Tablespoons  Melted Butter
   1 1/2     Teaspoons  Olive Oil
                        Salt
                        Pepper
     1/3           Cup  Dijon Mustard
       3   Tablespoons  Scallion -- minced
     1/2      Teaspoon  Tarragon
       5         Drops  Hot Pepper Sauce
   1 1/2          Cups  Fresh Bread Crumbs

Butterflied chicken.  To butterfly a chicken.  Choose a 3-1/2 lb. broiler/fryer chicken.  With a heavy knife or sturdy shears, cut down close to the backbone from neck to tail on each side to remove it.  Spread the chicken skin-side up on your work surface and bang the breast with your fist to break the collar bones and some of the ribs; this flattens the chicken.  Fold the wings akimbo behind the shoulders, and then make a slit in the skin at either side of the breast tip.  Push the knee of the drumstick firmly up under the armpit to loosen the joint, then insert the tip of the drumstick through the skin slit.  Repeat on the other side.

Broiling:  brush butterflied chicken all over with a combination of butter and olive oil.  Arrange the chicken skin-side down (flesh-side up!) in a broiling pan (not on a rack) and set them so the surface of meat is about 5" from the hot broiler element.  After 5 minutes, brush the flesh, which should just be starting to brown, with butter and oil.  Baste again in 5 minutes - use juices in the pan as butter mixture is used up.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and turn the chicken skin-side up.  Broil and baste 10 minutes more.

NOTE:  For a plain broil with no mustard and crumbs, give 15 rather than 10 minutes to a side, until juices run clear yellow from pricked drumsticks.

Mustard and herb coating.  Drain fat and juices out of pan into a small bowl; skim off and discard all but about 4 tablespoons of fat from top of juices.

Blend mustard in another bowl with scallions or shallots, tarragon and hot pepper sauce.

Beat up reserved fat and juices and blend half of them into the mustard.  Spread the mustard over the chicken, then pat on a coating of fresh white breadcrumbs. (Cut crusts off homemade-type fresh nonsweet bread; crumb in a blender or a processor.)  Baste crumbs with remaining fat and juices.

Final cooking.  Roast in the upper third of a 400-degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes (20 minutes if cooking is delayed).  Crumbs should brown lightly.

Chicken is done when drumsticks are tender when pressed.

Carve into serving pieces at the table, or arrange them on a hot platter in the kitchen.

BARBECUE NOTE:  
The crumb coating makes for difficult barbecuing, since the crumbs tend to burn and fall off into the fire.  However, you can use just the mustard and herb mixture, basted on during the last few minutes of cooking (beat a few tablespoons of oil into the mustard to take place of chicken fat and juices).

       2   tablespoons  Olive Oil
       1         pound  Fresh White Mushrooms -- sliced
       1      teaspoon  Garlic -- minced
       8        ounces  Chicken Breast -- boneless, skinless;
     3/4      teaspoon  Salt
     1/8      teaspoon  Ground Black Pepper
       1           cup  Roma (plum) Tomatoes -- diced
     1/3           cup  Dry Marsala or Sherry
       2        pounds  Pizza Dough
       2          cups  Mozzarella Cheese -- shredded
       4   tablespoons  Parmesan Cheese -- grated

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large skillet heat oil until hot. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid evaporates, about 6 minutes. Add chicken, salt and black pepper; cook and stir until chicken is just slightly pink, 1 to 2 minutes.

Add tomatoes and marsala; cook and stir until most of the liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes; set aside. Divide pizza dough into 4 portions. On a lightly floured surface roll or stretch each portion into an 8" circle.

On one half of each circle, place 1/4 cup Mozzarella cheese; then, with a slotted spoon, top with 1/4 of the reserved mushroom mixture, another 1/4 cup Mozzarella and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, leaving a 1/2" border around the edge of the circle.

Fold dough over the filing; press edges together firmly. Carefully transfer to a large baking sheet. Using a sharp knife, cut a slit on top of each. Bake until crust is crisp and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.

                     Chicken Sauti with Curry and Basil

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         clove  garlic
       2   tablespoons  butter
       4         large  boned and skinned chicken breasts, about 1
     1/2                pounds

                        Fresh ground pepper
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
   1 1/2     teaspoons  curry powder
     1/2           cup  loosely packed fresh basil
                        Rice (optional)

                        Yogurt
                        Chopped scallions

COOKING: Chop the garlic. Melt butter in a large frying pan over
medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper and cook, turning
once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and continue cooking
for 30 seconds. Stir in 1/4 cup of the cream and 2 tablespoons water.
Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through,
about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving plate and keep warm. Whisk
in remaining cream and curry powder and bring to a simmer. Shred the basil
leaves and add them to the pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

SERVING: Pour sauce over the chicken breasts and serve with rice and curry
condiments if desired.

NOTE ON BASIL: Bocaccio and Keats recount versions of the story of
Lisabetta, whose tears watered the pot of basil where her lover's head lay
buried. The broad, shiny green leaves, exude the aroma of Italy-and pesto
and tomato sauces are evidence for this. But the versatile herb is a
fixture of several European and Asian cuisines.

   1 1/2        pounds  chicken -- cut up
       1                onion -- chopped
       1         pound  mushrooms -- chopped
       1         bunch  collard greens -- or spinach or other
       6        ounces  tomato paste
                        west African red pepper
                        salt

Stem and chop greens.  Put chicken, onion and mushrooms in soup pot.  Add enough water to just barely cover ingredients.  Turn on medium-high heat.  Cover and cook while you're washing and chopping the greens, about 10 minutes.  Add salt, red pepper and tomato paste.  Boil for about another 5 or 10 minutes.  Add greens and replace lid, steaming greens and stirring them in. Variations: sometimes we add some exotic ingredients like smoked fish and/or ground egusi (which is a kind of melon seed), but it's perfectly tasty without these additions. This is traditionally served with "fufu" which is a doughy starch made variously from gari (roasted, fermented, ground cassava), or from semolina flour or from various combinations of Bisquick, potato Buds, potato starch, etc. It's also good over rice.

       2        medium  pears -- finely chopped
       4          cups  oyster mushrooms -- chopped
       4   tablespoons  bourbon or whiskey
       2          cups  dry white wine, like Chardonnay

     1/2      teaspoon  salt -- divided
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground pepper -- divided
       6   tablespoons  toasted walnuts -- chopped

Instead of preparing dish in 2 batches, you will get better results if you work 2 pans simultaneously; divide ingredients between pans.

Lay chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thickness. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in flour, patting off excess.

In 2 large skillets over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons butter in each pan until melted. Add chicken, 4 halves per pan, and cook until nicely browned on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Remove chicken and set aside until needed.

Reduce heat to low, divide shallots and pear between pans, sauteing for 2 minutes. Then add mushrooms to each and saute for 2 minutes. Divide bourbon, Chardonnay and chicken broth between pans, increase heat to high and let sauce boil until slightly thickened and reduced by half, about 5 minutes.

Return chicken to sauce, reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken is firm and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season with remaining salt and pepper to taste. Place each chicken breast on a plate and divide sauce among them. Sprinkle with walnuts and serve immediately.

     1/2      teaspoon  Allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  Cinnamon

     1/4           cup  Cognac
     1/3           cup  Dry White Vermouth

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 
Place all the ingredients in a deep, heavy pot that can be covered. Combine everything very well with your hands. Seal the pot very tightly with foil. Place a cover over the foil. Pot must be very well sealed so that no juices or steam can escape. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Do not open the pot during this time. 
Serve piping hot, with good crusty bread for mopping up the juices and garlic. Open the pot at the table, so that the diners may get the full benefit of the marvelous fragrance that explodes out of the vessel.

       1         large  Egg White
   1 1/2   tablespoons  Water Chestnut Flour

Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part into 1" sections. Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan. Reserve.
Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. 
Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
Turn up heat slightly for chicken. Test a chunk first: chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are frying. Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. 
While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions & peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

       1                onion -- sliced into rings
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
      10                flour tortillas -- heated

                        OR
      12                flour tortillas -- warmed or crisped
   2 1/2        pounds  skinless boneless chicken breasts
     1/4        medium  onion
       2          cups  fresh orange juice
       4     teaspoons  olive oil -- if frying
                        TOPPING
       4          cups  shredded lettuce
       2          cups  sour cream
                        Green Olive-Cilantro Salsa
                        Fajitas

Place a piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap on a counter top or cutting board. Place 1 chicken breast on top and cover with another piece of waxed paper or plastic wrap. With a mallet, pound the chicken breast 1/8 inch thick. Continue in the same way until all the breasts are flattened. Set aside until ready to cook, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. 

When ready to cook the fajitas, finely grate the onion. In a large nonreactive dish, mix the onion and its juice with the orange juice and soy. Remove the waxed paper or plastic wrap, and place the chicken in the onion-orange-soy mixture. Turn to coat both sides. Set aside to marinate for at least 15 minutes and up to 45 minutes, turning once or twice. 

If grilling, prepare a charcoal fire and allow the coals to burn until they are mostly covered with white ash and a few red spots show through here and there. This will take about 40 minutes. When the fire is ready, place the chicken breasts on the grill rack, directly above the coals. Cook until no longer pink, but still moist in the center, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. 

If frying, divide the oil between two large frying pans and set over medium-heat until the oil begins to smoke. (You can use one frying pan to save on dishes and cook the fajitas in several rounds.) Add as many chicken breasts as will fit in one uncrowded layer. Cook until no longer pink but still moist in the center, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Remove and drain off any liquid from the pan. Continue cooking another round until all the breasts are cooked. Cut the chicken into thin strips. To assemble, place about 1/3 cup of chicken in the middle of a tortilla. Top with some shredded lettuce, sour cream, and Green Olive-Cilantro Salsa. Fold and serve. 
Serves 4-6.

       4                beef cubed steaks
       1           cup  flour
       1          tsp.  salt
       1          tsp.  pepper
       1           cup  buttermilk
       1                egg
       1          tsp.  chicken bouillon -- powdered
       2          tsp.  dry mustard
                        vegetable oil for frying
       4         Tbsp.  flour
   2 1/2          cups  milk


Mix 1 cup flour, 1/2-tsp. salt and 1/2-tsp. pepper in a shallow dish. In a second dish, mix the buttermilk, egg, mustard, and bouillon with a whisk. Add 1/2-tsp. salt and 1/2-tsp. pepper.

Dip each steak in the seasoned flour and shake off excess. Dip the floured steaks into the buttermilk mixture and again into the flour. Shake off excess.

Heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium high heat to 3600F. Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the oil.

Carefully drop the steak into the hot oil and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side until golden brown.

Drain on clean paper towels and keep warm.

Pour all but 4 Tbsp. of oil from skillet. Over medium heat, whisk in 4 Tbsp. flour. Slowly add 2-1/2 cups of milk, stirring continuously. Continue to stir until gravy thickens and just begins to boil. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

 
TIPS:

Serve with mashed potatoes and a salad.

Be sure oil is hot before placing the steaks in the frying pan. Oil that is not hot enough will result in soggy, greasy steaks.

       1                bay leaf
     1/4          cups  flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
                        white rice -- cooked, optional

Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. Preheat oven to 400F.  Combine first 6 seasonings in a small bowl and rub into chicken pieces.  Place chicken in a shallow baking pan and bake for 15 minutes. Set aside.  Place oil in a large, heavy pot. Add celery, onions, red and green peppers and garlic; cook over low heat, stirring, for 10 minutes.  

Raise heat to medium, add okra and cook, stirring, an additional 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf. Add chicken and any pan juices to the pot. Cover with reserved tomato juices, making sure that all the chicken pieces are covered in liquid.  Simmer over medium-low heat, partially covered, until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. 

Stir in 2 tablespoons parsley. Cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes longer. If gumbo begins to boil, reduce heat. Adjust seasonings to taste. Garnish with remaining parsley. If desired, serve hot over cooked rice.

NOTES : Fresh okra is not wide available, but frozen okra is sold in most supermarkets and makes a perfectly acceptable substitute. If using frozen okra, defrost it or tinse under cold water, then proceed.  When cooking up this gumbo, I've only called for a pinch of cayenne pepper, but you can add as much heat as you like.

Speaking of spaghetti, I gave a recital last Sunday, and my pianist and I arrived at the hall (out of breath, hungry, dusty, tired) early to warm up and try the piano out - but there was another function going on, so we couldn't use the piano and thus had an hour to waste.

There was one of those hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout places down the street (turned out to be darn good), so I had: House special lo mein (this an adaptation of Joyce Chen's recipe) I was served half of this as a "half order" for $4.65, and it was too much, so I suppose it makes enough for about 3 as a main course Bring a lot of water to the boil.

Dump noodles in; turn heat to low. Cook 3 minutes. Drain, toss with sesame oil and regular oil, set aside. In 4 separate dishes, combine each of the meats with 1/2 teaspoon sherry and 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch. Heat the 4 tablespoons oil in a skillet or wok to high.

Add meats in this order, stirring for a few seconds between each addition: pork, beef, chicken, shrimp. As soon as you've added and tossed the shrimp, add the mushrooms and cabbage. Cook until cabbage is wilted. Add scallions, soy, salt, and MSG. Stir. Add the noodles and the bean sprouts, and stir-cook for 3 min. Serve hot on a warm platter.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2 1/4   tablespoons  Coriander seeds
   2 1/4     teaspoons  Whole cumin
   1 1/2     teaspoons  Whole black mustard seeds
   1 1/2        sticks  One-inch stick cinnamon
       6         Whole  cloves
     3/8      teaspoon  Whole black peppercorns
     3/8      teaspoon  Ground nutmeg
   1 1/2         Whole  dried hot red chili
       3          cups  Grated fresh coconut
   1 1/2   1 inch cube  ginger -- chopped
       9        cloves  Cloves garlic
     3/4                Fresh hot green chili
   2 1/4          cups  Water
       6   tablespoons  Vegetable oil
       3        medium  Medium onions -- minced
   3 1/3        pounds  chicken parts -- skinned
   2 1/4     teaspoons  salt

Put the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, nutmeg and red chili in a small frying pan. Place over a medium flame. Now quickly 'dry-roast' the spices, stirring them frequently until they emit a very pleasant 'roasted' aroma. Empty the spices into a clean coffee grinder or spice grinder and grind until fine. Put spice in bowl.
Put the coconut into the same frying pan and dry roast it over a medium flame, stirring all the time. The coconut should pick up lots of brown flecks and also smell roasted. Put the coconut in the bowl with the other dry roasted spices.
Put the garlic, ginger, and green chili into the container of an electric blender, along with some water. Blend until you have a paste.
Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan or saute pan over a medium high flame. When hot put in the onions. Stir and fry them until they pick up brown spots. Now pour in the garlic-ginger mixture and stir once. Turn heat to medium. Put in the chicken pieces, salt, as well as the spice coconut mixture in the bowl. Stir and fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes or until it loses its pinkness and turn heat to low, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until chicken is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking period, making sure that you turn over each piece of chicken so that it gets evenly colored.

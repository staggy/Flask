   2 1/2          cups  tomatoes; canned, chopped

     1/2           cup  beef broth
       2   tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

In a medium bowl cover brown rice with hot water and soak for 3 hours. Drain.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine rice, 3 cups water, and 1 1/2 t salt.  Simmer covered for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Add the dillseed, marjoram, and 1/2 t pepper.  In a large skillet saute 1 1/2 cups chopped onion in 3 T hot vegetable oil until soft, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Add paprika and garlic, continue cooking and stirring for 2 minutes.  Stir in the rice mixture, eggs, bread crumbs, and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Core cabbage and, in a large pot, blanch the cabbage cored-side-down in boiling salted water for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Drain.  Remove 12 leaves and cut off one fourth of each leaf from the base.  Arrange 1 leaf curved-side down on a square of dampened cheesecloth and place 3 T of rice mixture in the center.  Wrap the leaf around the filling and twist the corners of the cheesecloth to form the leaf into a roll.  Continue making rolls with remaining filling.  Chop remaining cabbage to make 3 cups and, in a large frypan, saute with 1 cup chopped onions and 2 T vegetable oil until soft.  Add tomatoes, vermouth, broth, tomato paste, sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper.  Simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Adjust seasonings. Transfer cabbage-tomato sauce mixture to a large baking dish.  Arrange the cabbage rolls close together in one layer on the sauce.  Spoon some of the mixture over the rolls.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours. Baste rolls 4 to 5 times during cooking.  Let the dish cool.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Remove cheesecloth.  Heat in preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before serving.

Cut the stems and the tops (Just low enough to remove the pointy ends of the leaves) off of the artichokes. Mix cheese, garlic,and crumbs. Spread the artichoke leaves so you can fill each layer, from the outside in, with the crumb mixture.

 Place the artichokes in a pot with about 1-2 inches of water.  Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice over the top of each artichoke. Cover and steam 45 minutes or longer, checking occasionally that the water has not completely evaporated. The artichokes are done when a leaf can be easily pulled off.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                spaghetti squash (3 lb.)
     1/2           cup  scallions - minced
       2           cup  broccoli flowerets
       3    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2         pound  carrots - cut in 1" pieces
       3           cup  uncooked tomato sauce
       1                zucchini squash

Prepare UNCOOKED TOMATO SAUCE from recipe.  Bake the spaghetti squash in a preheated, 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until it can be pierced easily with a fork, let it stand for 15 minutes, and halve lengthwise.  Remove the seeds and scrape the flesh into a large bowl with a fork. In a large saucepan of boiling salted water boil the broccoli for 1 minute, transfer to a bowl of ice water with a slotted spoon and let it cool.  Boil the carrots for 5 to 6 minutes, transfer to ice water and cool. Boil zucchini for 3 minutes, transfer to ice water and cool. Drain the vegetables.  Trim the zucchini, halve it lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Cook scallions in the oil over moderate heat in a large skillet, stirring, until softened.  Add the broccoli, carrots, zucchini, salt and pepper to taste and heat the mixture, tossing it, for 3 to 4 minutes or until it is heated through. Add the mixture to the spaghetti squash with the uncooked tomato sauce, toss and transfer to a serving dish. Serve the dish warm or at room temperature.

       1                spaghetti squash -- 1 1/2
                        to 2 lbs.
       1           cup  grated cheddar cheese
       1           cup  grated mozzarella cheese

Cut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds. Place squash, cut side down, in 2" simmering water; cover and cook 15 minutes. (Now call the kids to watch!) Holding the hot squash in a potholder, run the tines of a fork across its pulp-and like magic, there is your spaghetti! Mix the strands with the cheeses, zucchini or peppers, sauce, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Scoop back into squash shells, top with Parmesan, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          Ears  field corn -- preferably white
                        Water
       2   tablespoons  butter
       2   tablespoons  bacon grease
       1      teaspoon  salt

 Using a very sharp knife, cut kernels off cobs - do not cut deeply.  The key to perfection is this dish is the manner of removing the kernels - almost knocking them off, disregarding the juice.  After the process is completed, scrape the cob to retrieve the milk.

 Place scraped cobs in a shallow glass baking dish with a little water to draw the remaining juice. Turn occasionally.  After 15 minutes or so, pour juice in with the kernels.

 In an aluminum or stainless steel skillet (iron will discolor) place corn, butter, bacon grease and salt.  Add a small amount of water to make the juices about the consistency of very thin white sauce.

 Uncovered, cook over medium low heat.  When mixture starts to boil, stir often.  In 20 or 25 minutes liquid should be thick and corn tender.

 Serve immediately.

 Serves 4 - 6.

 This dish freezes perfectly with a little variation in preparation.  Cook corn and its milk with salt, fats and a very small amount of water until hot, but do not let boil.  Cool slightly and freeze.  To serve, add more water and cook about the same length of time.

       1    Tablespoon  Cinnamon
       1    Tablespoon  Nutmeg

(a variety of crookneck squash of the gourd family)

Cushaw is not as difficult to prepare for cooking as most recipes read.  Remove ends.  Halve lengthwise, then cut into long narrow strips.  Peel, removing the green meat next to the skin.  Cut crosswise into 1" chunks.

Place in a large kettle and cover with unsalted cold water.  Cook over medium heat until tender - about 15 minutes - when pricked with a fork.  Drain well in colander then pat a little with paper towels.

Immediately place half of the cushaw in a 1 qt. casserole dish.  Chip half of butter and dot over cushaw.

Mix sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and sprinkle 1/3 of this over the cushaw.

Gently place the remaining half of the cumshaw on top and dot with the other half of the butter.  sprinkle with the rest of the spice mixture.

Mix slightly with care, as the cumshaw will break up easily.

Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about an hour or until nicely browned and topping is somewhat crusty.

Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2     teaspoons  cornstarch
       2   tablespoons  orange juice -- freshly squeezed
       2          cups  cranberries -- fresh
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated
       2     teaspoons  orange zest

Mix together the orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside. 

In a saucepan add the berries, water, sugar, spices, and orange zest. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the cranberries are tender. Return the mixture to a boil and add the orange juice and cornstarch slurry. Stir well while simmering for another 3 minutes or so.

This sauce is good warm or cold and can go in any number of directions from this point. Add a bit of fresh thyme and black pepper for a more savory version. For a dessert sauce, add other fruits, such as pears, or walnuts for crunch. Experiment and enjoy!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        pounds  potatoes
       2        pounds  Spanish onions
       4        ounces  butter
       1          Dash  salt
       1          Dash  white pepper -- ground
       2        cloves  garlic -- per cocotte

STEP ONE: Preparing the Potatoes--
Sweat the onions in melted butter until slightly browned. Peel and wash potatoes, slice thinly in the shape of the cocotte (a small cup-shaped baking dish). Rub cocotte with whole butter and garlic clove. Alternate layers of potato and sautied onions, seasoning each one until cocotte is full.

STEP TWO: Preparing the Custard Royale--
Combine 4 eggs, 8 ounces heavy cream, salt, and white pepper and pour over cocottes, pressing gently on potatoes to remove any air that may be trapped.

STEP THREE: 
Bake in preheated oven at 325 degrees F for approximately 45 minutes or until potatoes are tender and custard is set. Let sit 5 minutes before removing from cocotte.

     1/2           cup  California Raisins

Heat a large nonstick skillet over moderate heat. Add the couscous and toast the grains, stirring or shaking the pan frequently, until the grains become brown and fragrant.

Transfer to a plate. Add the almonds to the hot skillet and toast them in the same way, stirring frequently. Transfer them to another plate. Bring the stock to a boil with the celery, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne.

Simmer about 3 minutes or until the celery is slightly softened. Add the couscous and raisins to the saucepan and stir gently just to mix.

     1/4           cup  yogurt (thick)
       1           cup  chick pea flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  carom seed (ajwain in Hindi/vaamu in Telug
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili powder

                        Oil -- to deep fry

In a bowl mix all the ingredients except cauliflower pieces. The batter must have the same consistency as that of a cake.

Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter such that they are completely covered with the batter.

In a deep skillet heat oil on medium and when oil is hot add the batter-covered cauliflower pieces. Fry until this batch is about half done (just about when the color of the batter starts to change) and remove from heat and keep aside.

Do the same for all the batches. In the end take the first batch and refry them until they turn brown. Repeat for the other batches. 

Goes well with ketchup.

Wash artichokes; remove outer leaves until pale yellow leaves are exposed. Cut off top two inches and stems so artichokes will sit upright. Remove fuzzy centers and rub all surfaces with half of lemon. Add juice of remaining lemon to water and dip artichokes to preserve green color.

Mix mint and garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil and spoon into hollows of artichokes. Place in pan just large enough to hold them upright. Add water to depth of three inches, remaining olive oil and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 25 minutes or until just tender.

Cooking will vary with size of artichokes. Remove artichokes, drain and hold warm. Reduce cooking liquid until of a syrupy consistency. Spoon sauce over artichokes and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         dozen  fresh red radishes
       3   tablespoons  Peanut oil
       2     teaspoons  Salt
       1      teaspoon  Sesame oil
       1      teaspoon  White vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  Fresh ginger juice
       1      teaspoon  Sugar
                        Chinese parsley garnish
       3     teaspoons  Thin soy sauce

Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash. Using bottom of heavy drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them not mash them so dressing can get into flesh. 

Avoid rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day. Sprinkle radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare dressing Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice. Double amount of vinegar for a sharper taste, if desired. 

Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, transfer radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.

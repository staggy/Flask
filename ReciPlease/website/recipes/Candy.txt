  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4 1/2          cups  sugar
       1       lg  can  evaporated milk
       1           cup  butter
      18        ounces  chocolate chips
       3   tablespoons  vanilla
       1          dash  salt

Cook sugar and canned milk to rolling boil for 6 minutes; Stirring constantly. Use large stainless steel pot; remove from heat. Add butter, chocolate chips, vanilla, and dash of salt Stir until mixed. Pour into buttered pan. Let stand 6 hours before cutting. Will keep a long time in cookie tin or a sealed container in a cool place.

 * The original recipe calls for 1/2 lb butter, but I find that the butter "pools" on top of the finished fudge. I only use 12 T of butter and my fudge turns out fine!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  confectioners sugar
     1/2           cup  cocoa
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  milk
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  butter -- or margarine
       1           cup  nuts -- chopped

In 1 1/2 quart casserole stir sugar, cocoa, salt, milk and vanilla together until partially blended (mixture is too stiff to thoroughly blend in all of dry ingredients). Put butter over top in center of dish. Microwave at High (10) 2 minutes. Stir vigorously until smooth. If all butter has not melted in cooking, it will as mixture is stirred. Blend in nuts. Pour into wax paper lined 8 x 8 x 2-inch dish. Chill 1 hour in refrigerator or 20 to 30 minutes in freezer. Cut into squares. Makes about 36 squares. PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE: Follow directions above except substitute 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter for cocoa. Add peanut butter after microwaving (I like chopped peanuts for this one.) COFFEE FONDANT: Prepare 2-Minute Fudge as above, except omit cocoa and substitute 1 tablespoon instant coffee granules dissolved in 2 tablespoons milk. Before fondant sets, press "chocolate shot" decors into top.

       4         large  eggs -- at room temp

     1/2           cup  flour
       8        ounces  walnuts -- chopped

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375:. Line a 9x13" baking pan with a double thickness of aluminum foil so that the line foil extends 2" beyond the sides of the pan. Butter the bottom and sides of the foil-lined pan. In the top of a double boiler set over hot, not simmering water, melt the chocolate, butter and dissolved coffee, stirring frequently, until smooth. Cool the mixture, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. In a large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at high speed, beat the eggs for 30 seconds, or until foamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat for 2 minutes, or until the mixture is very light and fluffy. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually beat in the chocolate mixture until just blended. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour. Stir in the walnuts. Do not overbeat the mixture. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake for 28-30 minutes, or until the foggies are just set around the edges. They will remain moist in the center. Cool the foggies in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight or for at least 6 hours. Remove the top foil and run a sharp knife around the edge of the foggies. Using two ends of the foil as handles, lift the foggies onto a large plate and peel off the foil. Invert them again onto a smooth surface and cut into 16 rectangles. Makes 16 foggies.

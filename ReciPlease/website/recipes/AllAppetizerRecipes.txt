Cut in half lengthwise and transfer to a baking sheet. Brush each half with remaining egg mixture. Sprinkle 1 half with sesame seeds and the other half with poppy seeds. Cut each half in 10 triangles and separate slightly to prevent sticking. Bake in preheated oven 10-12 minutes or until light golden and cooked through. Cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container up to 2 weeks.

     1/2           cup  monterey jack cheese -- grated
       1                red bell pepper -- seeded
                        -- finely chopped
       4                roma tomato -- peeled, seeded and

       4        ounces  chopped green chilies, canned
       1    tablespoon  fresh cilantro -- finely minced
      16        ounces  phyllo dough -- thawed
                        -- in refrigerator
       1           cup  butter -- or as needed, melted
                        -------relish-----
       2   tablespoons  olive oil
       4           ear  corn -- kernels scraped off
       6                roma tomatoes -- finely chopped
       1         large  onion -- finely chopped
       1    tablespoon  fresh cilantro -- minced
                        salt -- to taste
                        black pepper -- to taste

Cut dough crosswise into 5 equal sections. If you want to serve it as an entree, then cut the filo dough into 4 sections so that the triangles will be larger. Make 4 or 5 of them per serving.     

In a medium bowl place the chicken, cheese, red bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, green chile peppers, and cilantro. Mix the ingredients together well.     

Preheat the oven to 400:.      

For each section of the filo dough (cover the other sections with a slightly damp cloth and keep them in the refrigerator), separate the pieces and lay them out flat on a large surface (work quickly). Brush all the pieces with the melted butter. Turn them over and brush the other side.      

Place a teaspoon of the chicken mixture at one end of each piece of dough. Fold the bottom left corner over the filling so that the bottom edge lines up with the side edge. Continue to fold the dough up in this manner (as you would fold a flag,) so that a multi-folded triangle is formed. Keep the completed triangles under a damp cloth.      

On an oiled baking sheet, place the filo triangles and bake them for 20 minutes, or until they are a golden brown.      

Serve the triangles with the Corn Relish and Guacamole on the side. 

RELISH: In a medium large saute pan place the olive oil and heat in on medium until it is hot. Add the remainder of the ingredients and saute them for 10 minutes, or until the corn is done. Makes approximately 4 cups.

     2/3         pound  ground pork
       1           cup  chinese cabbage -- minced
       2                green onions -- minced
       1                egg
       1    tablespoon  light soy sauce

     1/2           cup  peanut oil
       1           cup  water

Combine port, cabbage, onion, egg, soy sauce, salt, orange peel and hot chili oil in large bowl and mix well. To assemble:  Dust waxed or parchment paper with cornstarch.  Set 1 rounded teaspoon filling in center of won tom skin, pressing lightly so filling forms narrow band across middle. Moisten rim of skin.  Bring opposite sides together to form semicircle.  Pinch together around outer edge.  Transfer to cornstarch dusted paper.  Cover with dry kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining won ton and filling.  Place two heavy 12" skillets over low heat.  Add 1/4 cup oil to each. Arrange dumplings in skillets in rows, fitting closely together.  Increase heat to medium-high and cook uncovered until bottoms are deeply golden, about 2 minutes, checking occasionally.  Add 1/2 cup water to each pan and cover immediately.  Let steam until skins are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Remove cover and continue cooking over medium to medium-high heat until bottoms are very crisp and well browned.  Drain off excess oil if necessary.  Loosen dumplings with spatula and transfer to serving dish.  Serve immediately.

NOTES : The above recipe is based on an Indonesian dish traditionally made with peanuts. We are using almonds here. Peanuts are not recommended. A fungus called aflatoxin naturally occurs in the peanut crop. Although the crops are inspected for it, a certain percentage is allowed and since it is a proven carcinogen, peanuts are best left alone. Another reason peanut butter isnt recommended is that it is not possible to make a butter out of raw peanuts. Peanut butter is produced from roasted peanuts.

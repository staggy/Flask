  *Make your own nutritious, homemade pancake mix. Store the dry mix in an airtight container--add the wet ingredients when you are ready to prepare the pancakes.  Combine the mix with the egg, milk, and oil.  Do not overmix; the batter will be slightly lumpy.  Heat a TEFLON pan, or other pan spray with nonstick cooking spray, over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the heated pan. When the cakes are bubbly on top and brown on the bottom, flip and brown on the other side.

       2   tablespoons  cake flour
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       2     teaspoons  baking powder

       1           cup  milk
       1         spray  shortening

  Preheat oven to 425~.   In a food processor or a large bowl,mix the flour with the salt,sugar and baking powder.Cut the shortening into the dry ingredients until the mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Separately mix the egg with the milk,and stir all but 2 tbs. of this liquid into the dry mixture.   Mix just enough to make a uniformly moistened dough. Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a greased and cornmeal coated cookie sheet about 1" apart.   Brush tops with reserved liquid.Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and brown,about 12 minutes. Cool for a few minutes before serving. Yields about 15 biscuits.

                     Basic Crepes #2

Recipe By     : Possum Kingdom Lake Cookbook
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2                Eggs -- slightly beaten
     2/3           Cup  Milk
       3   Tablespoons  Oil
     1/2           Cup  All-Purpose Flour
     1/4      Teaspoon  Salt

In medium bowl, stir together beaten eggs, milk and 1 Tbsp. oil.

Gradually stir in flour and salt; beat until smooth.

Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.

Lightly brush a six or seven inch crepe pan or skillet with some of the remaining oil; heat until hot.  Stir batter.

Pour about 2 Tbsp. batter into hot pan; tilt quickly so that batter runs to cover the bottom of the pan thinly but completely.

Cook, turning once, until light brown on both sides.

Repeat, using all the batter.

Brush pan with oil when necessary.

Recipe make about 12 crepes.

NOTES : Tip for better crepes.  Batter should be about as thick as heavy cream.  The pan should be quite hot but if oil begins to smotke, lift pan from heat source until it cools slightly.  Expect the first few crepes to stick to the pan.  If early crepes come out misshapen, use them for deep-frioed snacks or noodles.

                     Basic Crepes #1

Recipe By     : Mrs. A. Corbett Alexander, Swannanoa, North Carolina
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2          Cups  All-Purpose Flour
     1/2      Teaspoon  Salt
       4         Large  Eggs
       1           Cup  Milk -- cold
       1           Cup  Cold Water
       4   Tablespoons  Butter -- melted
                        Salad Oil

Combine flour, salt and eggs; blend well.

Blend in milk, water and butter.  Mix well.

Refrigerate batter for at least 2 hours, allowing the flour particles to swell and soften so that the crepes are light in texture.

Brush the bottom of a 6 or 7" crepe pan or heavy skillet lightly with salad oil and heat pan over medium heat until just hot, not smoking.

Pour scant 1/4 cup of batter in pan and quickly tilt pan in all directions to run batter all over bottom of pan in a thin film.

Cook for about 1 minute.  Lift edge of crepe to test for doneness.

The crepe is ready for flipping when it can be shaken loose from the bottom of pan.

Flip the crepe and cook for about 1/2 minute on other side; this is rarely more than a spotty brown and is used as side on which filling is placed.

Crepes can be made in advance and stacked between layers of waxed paper to prevent them from sticking.

Crepes can be frozen; heat them in a covered dish at 300 degrees to thaw.

Yield;  about 22 crepes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***FOR SOURDOUGH STARTER***
       2          cups  flour
       2          cups  warm water
       1       package  dry yeast
                        FOR HOT CAKES
       2                Eggs
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2   tablespoons  butter

 To prepare starter:

  Mix together 2 cups flour, 2 cups warm water, and 1 pkg. dry yeast in a bowl.   Cover with damp cloth and let stand in a warm place overnight or for at least 6 hours.  (If left in oven, there is not need to turn on oven; pilot light will provide enough heat or turn electric oven to "warm".)

To prepare Hot Cakes:

 Measure 1/2 cup sourdough starter and place in closed...

 Heat griddle over medium heat.

 Use 1/4 cup batter for one medium-size hot cake.  Pour onto hot griddle.  Turn hot cake when top is covered with bubbles and edges looked cooked.  Brown on second side.

Serve with honey and melted butter.

Makes 8 Hot Cakes.

 The yarns about Alaska's famous sourdough are as big as the country.  "Sourdough Pete," so the legend goes, first brought it from Michigan at the turn of the century.  The old-time prospectors and pioneers, nicknamed "sourdoughs," wore their precious sourdough starter in a bag inside their shirts and slept with it under the covers to keep it from freezing.  Trappers not only considered it their "staff of life" for the hot cakes, waffles, muffins and bread it made; they also used it for tanning hides!

                     Sour Dough Hot Cakes #2

Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        STARTER: Old time recipe.
     1/4       package  granular dry yeast
     1/4           cup  luke warm water
                        Flour

 Dissolve yeast in luke warm water.  Put dissolved yeast into a bowl and add enough flour (3/4 to 1 Cup unsifted) to make a running batter.

 Place in small crock or in large jar.  Do not cover tightly.  Just cover jar with a cloth or place a saucer over the top of the jar.

 Put in a warm place to sour.

 Each day for 5 days, add 1/2 cup luke warm water and enough flour to keep the batter at the same consistency.  You will then have a sour dough starter.

 For really good flavor, dough should be properly soured before using.

 Every time you use some of the starter again add water and flour.

 If you use only occasionally, you may store it in the refrigerator and feed it every week with flour and water.

 Never put any of the mixed batter into the starter.  Keep it perfectly free from fat, egg or other leavening material.

FOR HOT CAKES: 3 Well beaten eggs 1 Cup milk 2 Cups sour dough mix 1 3/4 Cups sifted flour 1 Tsp. soda 2 Tsp. baking powder 1/4 Cup sugar

 Combine all ingredients.

 Bake on a greased griddle.

 These can be made on an ungreased griddle but in that case 1/4 Cup of melted fat must be added.

 To make thinner cake add more milk.

 Bake at 370 degrees.

                        PINNEAPPLE-CHEESE TOPPING
     1/4           cup  canned, juice-packed pineapple -- crushed,undrained
       4        ounces  light Neufchatel or light cream cheese -- softened and cubed
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
                        FRENCH TOAST
       3                extra-large egg whites
                        OR
     1/2           cup  Egg Exchange

       6        slices  French bread -- (1-inch-thick)
                        Sifted confectioner's sugar

In blender container or food processor bowl (or use electric mixer), place the pineapple, cream cheese and vanilla. Cover and process briefly so some chunks of pineapple remain. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
For French toast, in bowl whisk together egg whites, milk, orange juice and cinnamon until well blended. If baking toast immediately, preheat oven to 425'F. Spray 15x l0 x 2-inch jelly-roll pan (or cookie sheet with sides) with aerosol cooking spray. Pour egg mixture into pan. Arrange bread slices in egg mixture, turn to coat well on both sides. (If preparing ahead, cover pans and refrigerate up to 12 hours before baking).
If baking immediately, let bread stand 5 minutes to soak up liquid. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, turning bread slices over halfway through the baking time. To serve, arrange three slices bread on each plate; sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Top with a dollop of Pineapple-Cheese Topping. Serve with remaining topping.

     3/4           cup  fresh or frozen blueberries

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Grease a muffin pan with 2+1/2-inch diameter cups, or line with paper baking cup liners; set aside. In a bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; add frozen blueberries, and make a well in the center.  Pour the milk into a 2 cup glass measure and add egg and butter; blend well.  Pour liquid all at once into flour well.  (This method allows you to mix the batter with fewer strokes, avoiding overtiring.) Making 12 to 15 full circular strokes that scrape the bottom of bowl; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Batter 'should' be lumpy.  Fill each prepared muffin cup 2/3 full with batter. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until tops are lightly browned.  Remove muffins from pan immediately (otherwise moisture condenses on bottom of cups and muffins become soggy). Makes 12.

       1       package  Active Dry Yeast
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  Bulk Active Dry Yeast
     1/4           cup  Warm Water -- (110-115 Deg F)
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/3           cup  Butter OR Regular Margarine
       1    tablespoon  Orange Juice
       2     teaspoons  Rum Extract
       1           cup  Milk -- scalded
                        Unbleached Flour -- up to 4 cups
       2         large  Eggs -- well beaten
                        Fat For Deep Frying -- heated to 375
                        degrees F
                        Jam OR Jelly

Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. 
Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl. Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes).
About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.
Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut. Force about 1/2 teaspoon of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

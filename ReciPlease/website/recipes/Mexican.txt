For starters, you must place the tripe, water, onions, garlic, salt, and
pepper in a large kettle and let it simmer over low heat for
about two hours, skimming fat as necessary. 

Next, you must toast the chiles well. Then you slit them open and remove
the seeds and veins. You must grind them until they are very fine and then
you add them to the kettle. 

Continuing, you can add the cilantro and let it simmer for about two
hours. At last, you can add the hominy and cook for another thirty
minutes. Finally, it is a good idea to serve with lime wedges. This recipe
will serve from ten to about twelve people

       1                Green pepper -- chopped small
       1            tb  Chili powder

       1             t  Salt
       2            tb  Margarine or oil

   Soak the dried corn husks in cold water for 1 hour.


 For the filling, soak the TVP in 7/8 c. hot water for
  5 minutes. 

Saute the olive oil, onion, garlic and
  green pepper in a skillet.


Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, tomato
  puree and cayenne to the reconstituted TVP. 

Mix TVP
  and onions and heat together for 2 minutes.

Taste the
  filling and add a little hot sauce, if desired.
  


To make the masa dough, place the masa harina and
  salt into a bowl. Slowly add enough warm water (about
  1 1/2 cups) to make a firm but moist dough, working in
  the margarine or oil as you knead the mixture.

To form the tamales, use the palm of your hand to
  slap-pat the masa dough into flat patties a
  quarter-inch thick.

Fold patty around a spoonful of
  filling and place in a drained corn husk. Fold the
  husk over to enclose the filling. If husks are small
  or broken, use several pieces. 

Place 1 cup hot water
  in thebottom of a kettle, place a steamer rack in the
  kettle and stack tamales on rack. Cover pan, bring
  water to a boil, reduce heat and steam tamales 45
  minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1           can  Sweetened condensed milk
       1           cup  Milk
       3                Eggs
       3                Egg yolk
     1/2      teaspoon  Almond extract
       1      teaspoon  Vanilla extract

In a small saucepan melt sugar over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. 
Heat oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will fall as a liquid sauce over the custard.

                     Crab Quesadillas

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time : 0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
       1                garlic clove -- minced
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1                poblano chili
       1         pound  fresh cooked lump crab meat
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  minced fresh cilantro
      12       10 inch  flour tortillas
   1 1/2          cups  grated jalapeno jack cheese
                        salsa

Place the butter and oil in a medium saucepan and heat over low heat until the butter is melted. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a small cup and add the garlic and onion to the pan. Saute over medium-high heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chili, crab, mayonnaise, salt, and cilantro. Mix well. To soften the tortillas, place them on a heated grill or skillet for about 15 seconds on one side, then turn. Brush one side with the butter-oil mixture, turn the tortilla over and spread the crab mixture on one half of the tortilla, and top with a tablespoon of grated cheese. Repeat until all the tortillas are filled. At this point, the quesadillas can either be sauteed or finished in the oven. If sauteing, heat a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for about 2 minutes on a side, or until golden brown. Or preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake on a cookie sheet until the tops are golden , about 5 minutes. Cut into quarters and serve.

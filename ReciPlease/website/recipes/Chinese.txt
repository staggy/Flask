DIRECTIONS This recipe is for 4 but can be cut in half for 2. I usually make the whole thing up so I can enjoy it the next day for lunch or as a side dish when completely mixed into the rice.  I holds well in the fridge if covered tightly. Cut chicken into strips. Toss with 1 TBS soy and set aside.  Mix together remaining soy, chicken broth and cornstarch.  Set aside. Heat 1 1/2 TBS oil in wok or large fry pan and quickly stir fry the drained chicken strips until browned.  Be sure wok is hot.Remove from wok and keep warm. Add remaining oil to wok and stir fry all veggies over medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Add the broth mix, bring to a boil--stirring constantly. Return chicken to the wok, add the nuts and heat about one minute.  Serve immediately over white rice. Please try the sticky rice, folks. Once you d you will probably never go back to the minute again. The oil can be cut back if you desire without affecting the final results. BTW, is anyone out there reading the posts of those who are taking their time? How about joining in for some variety. I know would like some new ones such as from  Kathleen and Rita and Frank and Bev etc., etc., etc.. GUY  FROM:       GUY ATTWOOD (NFWF89A)

       1      teaspoon  five spice powder*
      12       squares  won ton skins -- slice
     1/2           cup  sliced green onion (1 bunch)
       2         ounce  rice noodles
     1/4           cup  chopped toasted almonds
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
       1          head  lettuce -- shredded
       1    tablespoon  prepared mustard

Steam chicken breasts or cook in micro until barely done; skin, bone and shred (this is easy if you used 2 forks). In medium sized bowl, mix soy sauce, mustard, oil and Five Spice Powder (available in Asian food sections of most super markets - at least in California) and green onions; marinade chicken in this sauce, covered. Heat oil VERY hot (drop a piece of won ton skin in - if it floats right back up, oil is hot enough). Fry won ton skins until just beginning to turn golden; remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels (they will continue to brown when removed from heat). Fry noodles, a very few at a time, in hot oil - they will puff up almost immediately. Remove and drain immediately (they will be white). When ready to eat, slice lettuce (reserve some whole leaves to garnish bowl) thinly, add chicken and marinade, fried won ton skins and fried noodles (crumble a little as you add them), and almonds. Serve from large bowl ringed with whole lettuce leaves. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00

     3/4           cup  olive oil -- **
       1           cup  all purpose flour**

Preheat oven to 325 *large heads of (about 50 cloves) **or as needed As the coating hardens and bakes on the chicken, the flavors and juices are all sealed in.. Best chicken you ever ate. Put peeled garlic cloves in blender with 1/2 cup of olive oil and Cajun spices. Blend until creamy consistency, add more oil if needed. Place the oil and garlic mixture in a large bowl. Add flour slowly, mixing until a very heavy, thick, smooth mud like consistency is achieved. With string, tie the chicken wings and the legs tight against sides of carcass. Using a spatula, completely coat chicken with Garlic Mud, as evenly as possible, using it all. Fill in all crevices between wings and legs. Place on a rack, breast side up, in a pan and put in preheated oven. Roast whole chicken about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours or until coating is browned well. If using cutup chicken, coat each piece very well, place on a rack and roast for a shorter time, until chicken coating is brown. Serve chicken with the crisp pieces of Garlic coating ..  I would suggest using a vertical roaster. It is a wire stand that the chicken slips down on and is vertical. Set your bottom rack as low as possible to accommodate in oven. Even a lower heat setting with a longer roast time is even better. >>> This is a modification of an old Chinese recipe called Beggers Chicken. They used mud to encase it...Then put into a hot bed of coals to cook.... FROM: MARTY FEINS

Pour sauce over all and heat through.  Serve over chow mein noodles with steamed rice on the side.  Note: to cut down on sodium I rinse all canned vegetables well. If you like you  can add chopped green peppers, fresh mushrooms and thin sliced  cabbage when  stir frying the vegetables.   You can also use chicken or beef if you prefer  not to use pork.

       1    tablespoon  vodka
       2           cup  oil -- for deep-frying
   1 1/2      teaspoon  salt
       6    tablespoon  salt -- coarse
     1/8      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  black peppercorns
       1           cup  all-purpose flour
       2    tablespoon  Szechuan  peppercorns
       2      teaspoon  baking powder

Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the vodka, salt, and pepper while you make the batter.

 In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold water, whisking until smooth.

 In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F.  Add 1 tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine.  Take a shrimp by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail), then slide it into the hot oil. Deep-fry all the shrimp, a few at a time, until golden brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each batch. Drain on paper towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish, with the salt/pepper mixture for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.

 FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns.  In a dry frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture.  When browned remove and run the mixture through a grinder.

       1            mm  :mk vmxv03a
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
       1         pound  fresh thin noodles
       1    tablespoon  thin soy sauce
                        peanut oil
       1    tablespoon  chinese rice wine or dry
     2/3           cup  chicken broth
                        sherry
                        bbq pork & vegetable topping:
       1    tablespoon  oyster sauce
       2    tablespoon  peanut oil
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch in 2 T cold
       1         pound  bok choy -- in 2-in sections
                        -  chicken broth

This is a basic chow mein. You can add meat or vegetables as you like. BLANCH 1 POUND FRESH noodles in boiling water to wash away the starch and to loosen them up (about 2 minutes). Drain them well. Scatter the noodles in a baking pan. Use a pair of chopsticks and your hands to untangle them as much as possible. Put a layer of the noodles 1-inch deep in each of 2 large, heavy skillets. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil and 1/3 cup chicken broth in each. Cook over a low flame until the broth boils away and the bottom becomes brown and crisp. From time to time, add a little oil and broth to keep the noodles moist and allow the crust to develop slowly. This should take about 10-to-12 minutes. To flip, first shake the pan to make sure the cake is not stuck to the bottom (if it is, dribble some oil around the edge to loosen it). Cover the pan with a wide lid. Flip the skillet over, holding the lid firmly. The cake will drop onto the lid. Slide the cake back into the pan to brown it on the other side. Add more oil around the edge if it seems to be sticking. To serve, slide it out onto a plat e and use it as a base for any dish with sauce. TO MAKE THE PORK AND VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the peanut oil in a wok. When it is hot, add the bok choy and stir-fry to coat with oil. Add the pieces of pork and stir-fry to heat through. Add the broth. Stir in the soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, and oyster sauce. When the sauce is hot, thicken it with the dissolved cornstarch and serve on the bed of pan-fried noodles.

                        radish -- shredded
                        cucumber -- thinly sliced

* Prepare vegetables by cutting the asparagus into 3-inch lengths, the carrots into 3-inch sticks and green onions into 2-inch lengths. Shred radishes  and slice cucumbers thin (optional ingredients) **Use toasted walnuts or almonds, chopped In a large saucepan, cook asparagus, carrots and green onions in a small amount of boiling, lightly salted water for 7-9 minutes until crisp-tender; drain well.  Meanwhile for the sauce, stir together sweet-sour sauce, pineapple or orange juice and grated ginger root (or 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger) Set aside. For omelets, combine eggs and water in a small bowl. Use fork to beat until combined but not frothy.  In an 8-10 inch skillet with flared sides, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil until a drop of water sizzles.  Lift and tilt pan to coat all sides of skillet.  Add 1/2 cup of egg mixture and cook over medium heat.  As eggs set, run a spatula around the edge of the skillet; lift eggs and let uncooked portion flow underneath.  When eggs are set but still shiny, transfer to a warm plate, cover with plastic wrap.  Repeat with remaining egg mixture and oil as needed to make 2 omelets. To assemble, spread some of the sauce onto each omelet. Arrange steamed vegetables on one quarter of each omelet, fanning vegetables to edge of omelets.  Fold each omelet over vegetables; fold again.  Top with additional sauce and sprinkle with nuts. Jo Anne Merrill  recipe from my files.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2           cup  very strong black tea
                        from fireplace
     1/3           cup  salt
       1           cup  lime*
       2           cup  ashes of pine wood
      12                fresh duck eggs
                        ashes of charcoal and ashes

These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the preserving process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased individually in Oriental markets.

 Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg, thickly coat each egg completely with this clay-like mix- ture. Line a large crock with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top. Cover with more soil and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to cure for 100 days. To remove coating, scrape eggs and rinse under running water to clean thoroughly. Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when sliced, will be a grayish-green color.

 To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:

 Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable  Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1 tablespoon minced ginger root.

 *Available in garden stores and nurseries.

 The description of the whites turning grayish isn't quite accurate from the ones I've seen. They're more a dark blackish amber color-- quite attractive actually.

   1 1/2      teaspoon  cornstarch**
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       3    tablespoon  stock**

*This dish originally used 1 lb. of flank steak which was cut against the grain into thin slices and then marinated same as the tofu. Sometimes I make it with steak or tofu or a mixture of both. In addition, I occasionally add a small bok choy which is first blanched and then cooled. If other vegetables are added, increase the cornstarch mixture to three times what is listed. Recipe can be doubled and comes out fine. **Mix the cornstarch with the soup stock and have ready until needed. Get tofu ready according to your favorite methods. I usually slice it lengthwise in half- inch blocks, put paper towels over and under it, and press with telephone book to get out excess water. Mix together the sherry, salt, pepper, soy sauce, sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. of the oil in a shallow dish. Add the tofu or steak shreds and leave to marinate for 15 minutes. 06/02/92       10:07 PM Heat 2 1/2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a wok or pan over high heat. Add the ginger and onion and stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes (about). Remove onions, place in a colander, and let drain. You can use the oil left in pan if it is enough. Heat wok again. When it is very hot, add the tofu or steak and garlic. Stir-fry the tofu or steak and garlic in the oil for until brown. Mix in the onion and ginger and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring for about 30 seconds or until thickened. From "The Encyclopaedia of Chinese Cooking". Karen Alder Fngp13B

Add broth, soy and sugar, stirring until it comes to a boil. Thicken mixture with cornstarch paste, a little at a time, do not let it get too thick, should be like a cream sauce. Slowly stir in beaten eggs. Cook one minute, then add shrimp. Mix well and serve. *note* Fermented black beans have a flavor that is very unique. Do not substitute with any other black bean mixture as it will change the taste quite a bit. If you do, lotsa luck.... FBB are small, black, dry and very salty.

Cut the chicken thighs in half across the bone. Marinate them in the soy sauce, sherry, ginger & enough cornstarch to make a thick sauce for 1 Hr.  Add the sesame seeds.  Deep fry pieces in peanut oil at 375 until lightly browned. You can try substituting beef for the chicken. FROM:    DIMAS LIZARDO (FHND96B)

       2      teaspoon  sesame oil

*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into thin slices **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate for 30 minutes. Heat wok over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil. Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds. Add broccoli and stir-fry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp tender. Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated. Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stir-fry until lightly browned but not cooked through. Do not stir-fry too vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss. When hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (it's a good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a  02/24/92        4:15 PM platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor enhancer rather than a sweetener.

       1      teaspoon  spicy sesame oil

Makes 4 to 6 Servings  Fresh bean sprouts are a must for this recipe from China's Hunan province. The canned variety don't have the requisite crispness. Keep a close eye on the toasting sesame seeds so they don't burn.

 PREHEAT OVEN TO 300F. Toast the sesame seeds by spreading them over the bottom of a pie tin. Roast for 12-to-16 minutes, stirring often, until they are golden. The seeds can be toasted in advance and stored in an airtight container. Place the bean sprouts in a large heatproof bowl and set it aside. In a medium-size skillet set over moderately low heat, stir-fry the garlic, scallions and ginger in the oil for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are limp. Add all the remaining ingredients, increase the heat to moderate, then boil the mixture, uncovered, for 1 minute to slightly reduce the liquid. Pour the boiling dressing over the bean sprouts, toss well, then cover the bowl and chill the salad for several hours. Toss again before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------

Ingredients:

        1-2 lbs  spare ribs, each cut in thirds for smaller pieces

          1 Tbsp cooking wine (rice wine works well)
          2 Tbsp sugar
          3 Tbsp vinegar
          4 Tbsp soy sauce
          5 Tbsp water

Directions:

Heat a large skillet with some oil in it, and start to brown the spare
ribs.  Once the ribs are seared and browned, add the rest of the
ingredients. Mix well and bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to
medium-low.  Cook for about 20-25 minutes, and it's ready to serve!

Note:

When cutting the spare ribs into thirds, you can do it with a
well-sharpened cleaver.  However, getting the butcher to saw them with a
belt saw is usually better, as the cleaver creates bone fragments which
are unpleasant when eating the ribs. The saw, on the other hand, makes a
nice clean cut.

                     Red-Cooked Pot Roast (Shanghai Pot Roast)

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : Beef                             Chinese                          
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        pounds  Chuck roast -- boneless
       1    tablespoon  Sherry
     1/2           cup  Regular soy sauce
       1           cup  Water
       2        slices  Ginger
       2        cloves  Garlic -- optional
       1         ounce  Sugar
       2                Star anise stars -- optional

Either brown the roast in a little fat or dunk it in boiling water for a minute or so. Put it into a heavy kettle into which it fits fairly snugly.

Add all the rest of the ingredients (ginger slices, star anise, and garlic should be at the bottom of the pot).

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered, turning and basting occasionally, for 3 hours or until tender.

Serve sliced, hot or cold. If cold, you may want to weight it down with a brick covered in foil or some similarly heavy item while chilling it in the fridge.

You may cook lamb or pork this way, but cut the cooking time to 2 - 2 1/2 hr.

For lamb add a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise; for pork double the soy sauce and sherry, either halve or omit the star anise, and use up to 4 oz of sugar to taste.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  whole-wheat flour pastry
       1           cup  unbleached white flour
     1/2           cup  plus 1 tablespoon warm water
     1/3           cup  Cooking Sherry
     1/2           cup  Onion -- minced
     1/2           cup  Cabbage -- green, thin sliced
       2                Garlic Cloves -- minced

       5         large  Mushrooms -- coarsely chopped
       2   tablespoons  Low Sodium Soy Sauce
   1 1/2   tablespoons  Salt or herbal salt substitute

In large bowl, combine flours and water. Knead 15 minutes, adding more flour to water to create a smooth, pliable dough. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes. Heat sherry in a wok over medium heat. Stir-fry onion and cabbage until limp.

Add remaining pot sticker ingredients. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and place in colander to drain excess moisture. Divide dough into 24 small balls. On a lightly floured board, flatten each ball of dough into a 3-4" circle. Fill each circle with about 1 tablespoon filling.

Fold circle into half-moon shape; pinch edges to seal. Lightly coat two large nonstick skillets (or work in batches with one skillet) with vegetable coating spray.

Set over medium heat. When hot, add pot stickers seam side up, flattening slightly on the bottom. When bottom of pot stickers are golden brown, add 1/2 cup water per pan. Cover and steam for 20 minutes.

                     Stir-Fried Bok Choy In Garlic Oil

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3    tablespoon  peanut oil
       1      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2         pound  bok choy cut into 1-in pieces 
       4                garlic cloves lightly crushed & peeled

HEAT THE WOK over a high flame for 1 minute. Add the oil, and when the oil is very hot (this will take just a few seconds; pass your hand over it to feel the heat, or look for a wisp of smoke), add the salt, garlic and bok choy. A common mistake is to skimp on oil in stir-frying vegetables, which makes them dry out and burn. Use enough oil to coat the vegetables thinly but thoroughly. This may be prepared in advance and served cold.

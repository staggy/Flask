       4          cups  washed fresh blackberries

Sift together flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles large coarse crumbs. Sprinkle water over flour mixture,using a fork to stir it in gently to make it gather into a ball (the less water the better ~ just enough to hold it together).Turn out onto a lightly floured board and shape with your hands into two balls,one slightly larger than the other. Chill dough for 1 hour,then roll out large ball to fit the bottom of a 9 or 10" pie dish. Now, mix sugar and all-purpose flour in a separate bowl, then add a dash of salt and stir in berries. Pour mixture into the empty pie shell,then roll out remaining ball of dough to make top crust. Crimp and trim edges,then slash the top crust in several places. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 1 - 10" pie.

       3   tablespoons  quick-cooking tapioca
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
   2 1/2   tablespoons  butter

I like this pie not only for its flavor, but because the tapioca keeps the pie from being "runny" and the crust stays flaky. It's very quick to make. If you don't want to make your own pie crust, buy a package of Pillsbury Pie Crust in the red box found in the Dairy case at your supermarket. wash and cut fruit. In separate bowl, Mix together remaining ingredients except margarine and add to rhubarb & strawberries. Mix until fruit is well coated with mixture. Set aside for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, line a 9 inch pie pan with pie crust. Pour in fruit filling mixture and dot with margarine. Seal with top crust. Prick top crust to vent. Bake for approx. 55 minutes in a 375 deg. oven. Note: You might want to shield the edges of the crust during the first half of the baking with foil. Brush top crust with a little milk and sprinkle granulated sugar over milk during last 15 minutes of baking. Judy Garnett Raleigh, NC PJXG05A

1. Line 9" pie dish or pan with vanilla wafers. 
2. Make sauce by heating the chips, marshmallows, and evaporated milk together until smooth --(I use the microwave, stirring frequently--but you can use a saucepan). Stir in salt. 
3. Scoop about 1/3 of the ice cream into the wafer lined dish, drizzle about 1/3 of the sauce on the ice cream. Scoop another 1/3 of the ice cream and drizzle 1/3 of sauce. Scoop the remaining 1/3 of the ice cream and drizzle the remaining 1/3 of the sauce. Top with chopped nuts and/or Maraschino cherries if desired. 
4. Cover with foil or plastic wrap. 
5. Freeze until solid--this takes at least 6 hours--best to freeze overnight. 
6.To serve, remove from freezer about 20 minutes before serving to soften.

     1/2           cup  nuts -- chopped

Combine cookie crumbs and butter and press into bottom of buttered 9-10" pie pan. Refrigerate. When chilled, spoon one-half softened ice cream on top of crust. Pour half of Mud Sauce over ice cream and proceed with another layer of ice cream and top off with the remaining Mud Sauce. Mud Sauce: In medium saucepan, melt the sauce ingredients over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture thickens, adding vanilla after removing sauce from heat. Cool long enough so as to not melt the ice cream while pouring Mud Sauce over it. Top with Garnish and freeze. Garnish: Whip cream, add powdered sugar and Kahlua. Decorate top of Mud Pie with Garnish: Use decorating bag with star or shell tip or spread whipped cream over pie and sprinkle top with finely chopped nuts. Freeze solid.

 Ideas: Double the recipe and use a buttered 9 x 13" pan. This should serve 24 persons. If you don't like nuts on top, try chocolate curls. Use a block of chocolate and with a potato peeler, peel the chocolate along one of the edges. Use chocolate at room temperature or else you'll get bits and pieces of shavings.

*  2 (10 oz.) boxes, defrosted and drained. ** Jam should be heated until melted. Crust: Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips. Mix until blended.Pat mixture on the bottom and sides of a buttered 9 inch pie pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 8 minutes.Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top and return to oven for 1 minute to melt chocolate. Remove from oven and spread melted chocolate evenly on crust, forming a thin chocolate layer. Set aside to cool. Beat together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, beat the cream until it is stiff. On the lowest speed, beat the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until blended. Pour into prepared crust. Stir together the raspberries and melted jam until fruit is evenly coated. Gently spread raspberries over cream mixture.  Refrigerate. Note:When I double this, I double everything except the raspberries and use a 9X13 dish. After inviting 4 cooking instructors over for lunch one day, and wondering what I had gotten my self into (I was a nervous wreck - one of them was once with Pillsbury and the creator of their ready-made pie crusts) this is what I decided on for dessert. They all requested the recipe; so I thought it must be worth sharing it with my friends here.

       4   tablespoons  sugar
       2          cups  flour

       6        ounces  chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  corn syrup
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
       1                egg white
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       1      teaspoon  lemon juice
       1           cup  whipping cream

CRUST: Mix butter and together and add flour. Mix until crumbly (about 3 mins on med). Pat 2/3 of mixture into pie pan or spring pan and put remainder into a small pan. Heat both at 350 for about 15 mins (or until light brown). Stir the small pan amount once during cooking time to create crumbs. Once done put in refrigerator to cool completely. FILLING: Melt choc in corn syrup and 1/4 cup of water. (Can be done over low heat or in the microwave 4 mins on med.) Stir to incorporate and put in refrigerator to cool completely. Combine sugar, the other 1/4 cup of water, egg white, vanilla, and lemon juice. Beat on high speed until peaks form (this takes a long time about 20 minutes with my mixer). In a separate bowl beat the whipping cream until thick. Fold cream and half of the chocolate mixture into the egg white mix. Spoon into shell. Drizzle other half of the chocolate over filling and cut throughout with knife. Sprinkle crumbs over top and cool until firm (about two hours). This is my all time favorite pie, it is rich but sooo fabulous. (It can be made in a pie shell but I have best results in a spring release pan) Posted by Ann Morin, A.MORIN4 on Genie

(Use potato masher for best results). Beat in crushed pineapple and lemon peel.  Add cooled gelatin mixture.In a separate small bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, remaining packet of Buds and vanilla. Add remaining pineapple juice and lemon juice. Mix well.Stir into cheese mixture. In separate bowl, beat egg whites til they hold their shape. Gradually add remaining sugar and beat till stiff. Fold into cheese-crumb mixture. Pour into 9" pie plate-chill til firm. NOTE: I do NOT mix the crumb mixture with the cheese mixture, rather i press the crumbs into bottom of plate and pour cheese mixture into shell.  I do not know if this a misprint in the recipe or if it really is supposed to be all mixed together, but it doesn 't make sense to me to put those crumbs into the actual cheesecake filling-and the picture in the book definitely shows a crust-you be the judge.

       9             "  pie shell -- unbaked
       2          cups  rhubarb; fresh -- cut up
                        water (about 1 cut)
       1    tablespoon  margarine
   2 1/2   tablespoons  flour
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
       2                eggs -- separated
       3   tablespoons  water

1. Cut up rhubarb and scald in hot water about 5 minutes. Drain well and place in the bottom of the pie shell. 

2. In a small bowl, mix the margarine, flour and sugar together. Beat 2 egg yolks with 3 T water and mix in with the sugar mixture. Pour over the rhubarb. 

3. If desired (I don't) make a meringue out of the egg whites and add to the pie. I prefer to cook and eat it without the meringue. 

4.Bake in 350 degree oven for 30- 45 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream.

       6   tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- diced
       1                egg -- beaten
       6                ripe bananas
     1/2           cup  warm light cream
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
       1    tablespoon  cornstarch
       1      teaspoon  vanilla
       4                egg whites -- room temperature
       1         pinch  salt
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar

To make pastry, combine flour, sugar and butter in a food processor. Process until the consistency of fine meal. Add beaten egg; continue to process just until dough starts to come together. Gather into a ball, wrap and refrigerate for one hour or place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Roll out dough on a floured surface or roll out between two sheets of plastic wrap to an 11-inch circle. Dough is sticky and falls apart easily; just patch together and fit into a nine-inch flan pan with removable bottom; trim edges. (If you don't have a flan pan, a pie plate can be used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees for 12 minutes until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the bananas and arrange on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining banana and combine with warm cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool slightly. To make meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and glossy. Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15 minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           can  sweetened condensed milk
       4                egg yolks
     1/3           cup  bottled key lime -- (1/3 to 1/2)
       1                unbaked 9" graham cracker pie crust
                        whipped cream for garnish

This is mighty tasty and quite easy to make: Pre-heat oven to 325`F. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together sweetened con. milk and egg yolks until well-blended.Slowly stir in the lime juice ( for more tart flavor, use 1/2 cup juice), stirring gently just until blended. Pour into pie crust and bake for 10 minutes.Allow to cool at room temperature, then chill before serving. Top with whip cream, if desired...I think it's best with the whipped cream. 

Note: This recipe leaves room in the crust for whipped cream. If more filling is desired, increase the filling proportions by 1/2.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4          cups  cheddar; md -- shredded
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  sugar

       2     teaspoons  unbleached flour
       2     teaspoons  butter or regular margarine
       1      teaspoon  water

*    Use tart cooking apples such as Macs or Granny Smith's.  Core, pare CHEDDAR CRUST: Combine the flour, cheese and salt in a bowl. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the shortening until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle the iced water (5 or 6 tbls will be needed) and using a fork, toss the crumbs until a dough is formed. Press the dough firmly into a ball. FILLING: Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half, on a lightly floured surface, to a 13-inch circle. Line a 9-inch pie plate with the pastry, trimming the edges to 1/2-inch beyond the rim of the pie plate.  (Note:  When lining the pie plate, be careful not to stretch the pastry when spreading it out. This will cause holes or the pastry will shrink and the filling will run over in the oven as it is baked. Place in the pie plate and gently, working from the center, spread the pastry out until it covers the bottom of the pie plate and then lay the rest of the pastry over the rim and trim.)  Combine the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a bowl, mixing well. Arrange the apple mixture in the pastry lined pie plate.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle. Gently fold into quarters and cut steam slits in the folds. Unfold the crust and place on top of the filling, trimming the crust to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie plate.  Fold the top crust under the lower one and flute to form a ridge around the edge of the pie plate. Combine the egg yolk and water, then brush the mixture over the top crust and rim. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until apples are tender and the crust is a golden brown. Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm and serve with Vanilla Ice Cream, if desired.

The Bag may produce a small amount of smoke for the first few minutes. this has happen each time I have used this recipe. Just keep a close eye on it as it bakes.The bag should be folded closed when you put it in the oven. You"ll notice that as the pie bakes and the bag heats it will get darker in color-- that's normal.be sure to use oven mits when you open the bag after the pie is baked, there will be a small amount of steam escaping from the bag.

       1                bright-skinned orange

Preheat the oven to 375 F.  Line a 12-inch pie plate with one round, leaving the excess pastry to hang over, and chill. Using a pastry wheel, cut as many 3- to 4-inch-wide strips as possible from the other round for the lattice top.  Place on a parchment-lined or water-sprayed baking sheet and chill for at least 30 minutes.

Put the rhubarb in a large mixing bowl.  Combine the remaining ingredients in another bowl.  Sprinkle this mixture over the rhubarb and stir to coat all the fruit. Turn the fruit into the prepared crust. Weave the lattice strips over the filling, securing the ends by pasting them to the crust with a bit of water. Turn up the overhang of the bottom crust, trim, and crimp as desired. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the filling has bubbled and thickened. Let cool before serving.

                        -----custard filling-----

     1/2           cup  milk
                        cinnamon -- to sprinkle on top

Note:Perach Kisan is similar to Prusah Kisan but differs in fruit and the arrangement.**Fruit: 4 pounds of fresh Italian freestone prune plums, or 4 pounds of fresh apicots, or 4 (30 oz) cans unpeeled apricot halves.This makes two pies. Preheat the oven to 350. Put the piecrusts in the pie pans and finish the edges.Set aside. Wash and pit the fresh fruit, cutting each plum or apricot nearly in half from the stem to blossom end.Starting at the edge of the pastry-lined pan, arrange them standing up as close to each other as possible, with the hollow, or pit side facing the center. When the pan is filled, it should look somewhat like the petals of a blossom, with a single plum or apricot half in the center, open side up.Put all the ingredients for the custard filling, except the cinnamon, in a small bowl, and beat with a whisk until it is thoroughly mixed. Pour half the custard mixture over each pie and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the crust is lightly browned and the custard is golden brown.If you use the canned apricots, the procedure is much the same. Drain the apricot halves and make sure there are no pits in them. (Save the juice to use in a gelatin dessert or to sweeten a fruit drink.) Arrange the halves as described above and follow the remaining directions.

                        crust
       6          cups  apples
       1           cup  apple cider or juice
     2/3           cup  sugar
       2     teaspoons  cornstarch
       2     teaspoons  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon; ground
       1      teaspoon  butter

Divide the pastry almost in half and roll out the larger half on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch circle.  Line a 9-inch pie tin with the pastry.  Trim the edge to 1/2-inch beyond the rim of the pie tin.  Combine the apples, 1 cup of apple cider and the sugar in a 3-quart saucepan and cook, over high heat, until the mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 8 minutes or until the apples are tender.  Drain the apples, reserving the syrup.  Add enough additional apple cider to the syrup to make 1 1/3 cups.  Return the syrup and apples to the saucepan. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir until well blended.  Stir the cornstarch mixture and the cinnamon into the apple mixture.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil.  Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, then pour the mixture into the pastry lined pie tin.  Roll out the remaining pastry to an 11-inch circle. Fold the pastry gently, so as not to tear it, into quarters and cut slits in the folds.  Gently unfold the pastry on to the top of the filling and trim the edge to 1-inch beyond the rim of the pie tin. Fold the top crust under the lower crust and form a ridge by fluting the edge of the pie.  Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack until slightly warm before cutting and serving. NOTE: This is the perfect pie to serve with the rich cheddar sauce in this file.

I expect EACH and EVERY one of you to make this. Actually my friend Betty did and this is the recipe she used from JOY OF COOKING. It is delicious...  Cook the ingredients SLOWLY for 2 hours.  Prepare your favorite pie shells (for 2 crust pie) and heap with mincemeat; flavor w/ more brandy of course and bake at 450 degrees for about 30 minutes.  NOTE:  I set the ingredients to 20 the recipe for the mincemeat (20 pies) but you can reformat for 1; and 1 pie.

       2                pie crust -- may be frozen as
       1                apple pie; your fav recipe
     1/2           cup  pecans -- whole
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/2           cup  brown sugar

In this recipe, it is the construction that is important.  Get the apples and spices ready for your favorite 9" pie. Prepare or buy 2 pie crusts. Now get your pie pan ready. My daughter uses a pyrex pie pan. Butter the pie pan completely, and well. Don't miss a spot. Use the entire 1/2 cup of butter and get the sides too.Place the pecans in the bottom of the pie pan, and sprinkle with the brown sugar.  Now, put your bottom pie crust on top of the pecans. In fact, forget that they (the pecans) are there. Just proceed with your apple pie, as usual, with one exception. You don't want a bulging pie, kinda firm and flat.  When you have both crusts sealed and fluted, bake at 400 degrees for exactly 50 min.  Cool for 5 min. on a rack and turn out on a serving dish immediately. When you do this, you are flipping it over so that the pecans are on the top, and the usual top of the pie is on the bottom.  This recipe is my daughter, Lois's. She says that you must flip it out after 5 min. or the butter and sugar will harden den and you won't get it out. Let me tell you it is always a hit and people are astounded. The combination of the sugar, pecans and apple pie are delicious. You should keep your apple pie filling on the tart side. I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.  NOTE:   I  know that this is NOT a deep dish apple pie, but this is OUR Thanksgiving specialty and I hope you will all enjoy this.

Refrigerate until ready to fill.... Now here is where I get lazy.  I don't do this. I buy the ready made crust and sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar... Beat egg slightly in a large bowl.. Stir in sour cream, sugar, flour, vanilla and salt until smooth. Add sliced apples stirring gently just to coat. ( paring and slicing apples into cream mix helps retard browning. Spoon filling into shell. Bake in preheated very hot oven 450 for 10 min. Lower heat to moderate 350 and bake 35 min longer. While pie bakes prepare topping. Remove pie from oven. Sprinkle topping evenly over filling. Return pie to oven. Bake at 350 for 15 min until lightly browned. This is a very large pie  you could almost make two 8" pies!

Line bottom of pie plate with thin crust, let it drape over edge of plate. Slice apples into plate until it is HEAPED over top. Mix the cinnamon and flour into the sugar and pour this over the apple slices. Dot the top with pieces of the butter. Now cut around the plate to rid the excess crust. Roll out top crust and "smear" center (6 inches or so) with crisco... Make 5 or 6 slits near middle.. Sprinkle with flour.. Fold and put on pie. This makes it easier to place on pie. Unfold, then cut off to within 1 1/2 " any access and fold under the other crust making finger "folds" to seal all around.  Now walk to sink and holding pie in one hand ..run it quickly under cold water to PARTIALLY rinse off flour. This is what makes it "flaky". Cook at 350 for about 1 hour until golden brown and a sharp knife inserted feels NO firm apples

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1                baked pastry shell -- 9-inch
       1          pint  fresh raspberries
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1                unflavored gelatin envelope

     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- whipped
       1      teaspoon  lemon juice

Crush raspberries and pass through strainer to remove seeds (this is optional but it dramatically increases the enjoyability of the pie when you don't have to fight with raspberry seeds!). Either way, you'll need 1 cup of crushed fruit.  Add 1/2 C sugar and let stand 30 minutes. Soften gelatin in water; dissolve over low heat; cool. Add raspberries, lemon juice and dash salt. Chill, stirring occasionally till partially set. Beat egg whites to soft peaks; gradually add 1/4 c sugar, beating till stiff peaks form. Fold in strawberry mixture, then whipped cream. Chill till mixture mounds slightly when dropped from a spoon. Pile into cooled shell. Chill firm, about five hours. Trim with whipped cream. VARIATION: You may use strawberries instead of raspberries.

       1    tablespoon  Water
     1/3           cup  Creamy Peanut Butter
     1/3           cup  Sugar

       2   tablespoons  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Vanilla
       1           cup  Heavy Cream -- whipped

Prepare the Peanut Butter Cookie Crust. Crush the cookies and melt the butter or margarine. Combine them and mix well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie plate. Chill in the refrigerator until set.
Combine the chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon of light corn syrup and 1 tablespoon of water in the top of a double boiler. Cook over simmering water until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and cool well.
Meanwhile combine the peanut butter, 1/3 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of corn syrup, and 3 tablespoons of water in a 2-qt saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Pour into a bowl and stir in the peanuts; cool.
Beat the egg whites until foamy, using an electric mixer at high speed. Gradually add 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla and continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form when the beaters are slowly lifted. Fold the egg white mixture into the whipped cream. Then fold in the peanut butter mixture. Pour half of the peanut butter mixture into the peanut butter cookie crust. Drizzle half of the chocolate mixture over the filling. Top with the remaining filling. Drizzle the remaining chocolate in parallel lines over the filling. Pull a knife across the lines at 1 inch intervals. Freeze until firm.
Wrap securely in aluminum foil. Return to the freezer and continue freezing 8 hours or overnight. Remove from the freezer 10 minutes before serving.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  self-rising flour
       1                spoon vegetable shortening -- the size of a small
                        egg
                        buttermilk -- fresh

Use enough buttermilk to make the dough really sticky but still enough to knead and roll out.

Mix the ingredients together (add the buttermilk a little at a time). Turn out the dough on a floured board and knead in more self rising flour (but try not to handle the dough too much!).  Roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch and then fold the dough over to double it and press on it lightly.  This fold in the dough will make the biscuits pull apart easily after they are cooked.  Cut out biscuits about 2 1/2 inches in diameter using a glass dipped in flour.  Re-roll the dough as needed. Place the biscuits in a baking pan up close against each other - this will make them rise higher.  Some people put a little bit of vegetable oil in one end of the pan and run the tops of the biscuits through the oil then place them in the other end of the pan.  This makes them get crustier and browner on top.

Bake the biscuits at 450F until they are lightly browned (about 15 minutes).  Serve with butter, jelly, honey, or filled with bacon, sausage, etc.  1 cup of flour makes about 4 or 5 biscuits, but you can increase the recipe easily, just always use one spoon of shortening the size of a small egg for each cup of flour.

Don't get discouraged if they don't turn out right the first few times, it takes practice.  Be sure to use fresh ingredients.

       2    tablespoon  lemon peel
     1/2           cup  lemon juice -- fresh

For Scones:  Heat oven to 425~.  Sift dry ingredients together.  Cut in butter.  Add raisins or currents.  Mix buttermilk and egg together.  Add all at once to flour.  Mix with fork just until mixture clings together. Form into ball, turn out on floured surface and knead gently until smooth, not more than 5 turns of the dough.  Pat out til 1/2 inch thick and cut with a 2" cutter.  Place on baking sheet 1 inch apart.  Brush tops lightly with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Bake 10 minutes until golden brown. Serve with Lemon Curd.

 For Lemon Curd:  Beat eggs in top of double boiler. Stir in remaining ingredients.  Cook over simmering water 30 minutes, stirring frequently until thick and smooth.  (I do not use a double boiler, but use a low heat and watch closely to prevent burning). When it has thickened, remove from heat.  It will thicken more when cooled.  Cool, cover and refrigerate. Keeps 2 to 3 weeks in refrigerator. This has become a holiday breakfast tradition for our family and I give small jars of the Lemon Curd as gifts along with the Scone recipe for friends who bake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  garlic salt -- or powder
     1/4    tablespoon  parsley, freeze-dried
     1/4      teaspoon  Italian seasonings
       1         pound  bisquick baking mix
   8 3/4        ounces  cold water
     1/4         pound  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/8           cup  butter or margarine

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes. After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.) Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2 cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12 biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if desired.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          cups  all-purpose flour

       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
       1           cup  shortening
       1           cup  milk

Mix the flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl or in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add the shortening and cut in or process until the mixture is the consistency of coarse meal.  Pour in the milk and stir or process just until the dough holds together.  If it is dry or crumbly, add more milk.  If it is too wet, add more flour.  Knead briefly in the food processor, then turn out onto a floured board or beat 1,001 times with a rolling pin. when it's ready, the dough should "snap" when you hit it. Fold the dough in half. Roll out the folded dough until it is 1/2 inch thick. Cut with a 1-1/4-inch biscuit cutter into small rounds. Prick each round with a fork, making two parallel sets of holes in the biscuit.  keep rolling out the dough, folding before cutting, until all the scraps are gone and you have made about 100 biscuits. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place the biscuits on a lightly greased pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, until crisp, but not browned.  They should open easily when split with a fork.  They will keep for weeks tightly covered in a tin or in the freezer. Split in two before serving. From Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking"

To make dough: Measure all dough ingredients into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer, adding potatoes with liquid ingredients. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To shape and fill: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Roll to 15 W 9-inch rectangle; brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter. In small bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa and cinnamon; sprinkle evenly on dough to within 1/2 inch of edges.

Beginning at long end, roll up tightly; pinch seam to seal. With sharp knife, cut roll into 12 equal pieces. Place, cut sides up, into 12 greased (2 1/2-inch) muffin cups. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. 

Bake at 375:F for 15 to 20 minutes or until done. Remove from cups; cool on wire racks. Lightly sift powdered sugar over tops.

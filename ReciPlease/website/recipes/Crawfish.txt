Recipe By     :

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2   tablespoons  vegetable oil
       2        medium  onions -- medium diced
       2  large cloves  garlic -- minced
       4                celery stalks -- medium diced
       2        medium  green bell peppers -- medium diced
       6   tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
       6          cups  chicken stock
                        OR
       6          cups  canned chicken broth
   1 1/2        pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled and deveined
                        Ground black pepper (to taste)
       4          cups  cooked white rice
     1/4           cup  minced fresh parsley

TO COOK: Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add the next 5 ingredients; sauti
until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add next 4 ingredients; saute
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken stock; bring to boil and cook
over medium-high heat until thickened, about 30 minutes. Add shrimp;
simmer until shrimp are opaque throughout, about 4 minutes. Season with
1/2 teaspoon pepper or to taste.

TO SERVE: Ladle a portion of shrimp creole into each warm soup plate.
Spoon 3/4 cup rice atop each portion of creole. Sprinkle with parsley and
serve immediately.

The Pipers call this dish a "white creole" because it is not thickened
with the traditional mahogany-colored roux. Instead, a mixture of chicken
stock, tomato paste, and aromatic vegetables is reduced until the sauce
becomes quite thick and flavorful. It is best to serve this shrimp creole
with steamed white rice.

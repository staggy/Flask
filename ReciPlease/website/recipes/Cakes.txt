Drain bourbon from fruit; add bourbon alternately with remaining sifted dry ingredients to creamed mixture, ending with dry ingredients, beating well after each addition and scraping sides of bowl often.

Beat egg whites stiff but not dry; fold gently into cake batter, blending thoroughly.

Pour into prepared pans.

Large tube requires nearly 2 hours in preheated 275 degree oven; the smaller pan needs less time.

Cool cakes in pans on wire rack 10 minutes.

Remove from pans and peel off waxed paper; cool completely on rack.

Wrap cakes in cheesecloth saturated with bourbon; then wrap in plastic wrap.

Store in tight containers up to several weeks.

NOTE: Some people do not like the cheesecloth completely saturated with the bourbon, it does come out a little strong tasting.

                        -------apricot glaze--------
     1/2           cup  apricot jam

*  Egg yolks must be beaten into the cake one at a time so keep the yolks    separated from each other. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++ CAKE: To prepare cake, cream butter and sugar until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Beat in egg yolks, one at a time.  Mix in lemon rind and 2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and flour together. Gently mix into the butter mixture.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry.  Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.  Pour into a well-greased 10-inch tube pan.  Bake in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for about 60 minutes or until the cake tests done.  Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes and then turn out on wire rack to cool completely. Slice cake crosswise into 3 layers.  Pour about 2 T of rum over each layer. Butter-Cream Filling: For butter-cream filling, boil sugar and water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).  Beat egg yolks until very light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. While still beating the egg yolks, add the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Beat 5 minutes more, until very thick and doubled in bulk.  Slowly beat in the rum.  Beat the butter in a small bowl until soft and light.  Beat butter into the egg mixture a little at a time.  Continue beating until thick.  Chill until mixture can be spread.  If mixture is too soft, beat in additional butter. PRALINE TOPPING: While butter-cream is cooking, spread 2 T butter thickly in a 9 X 13-inch baking pan for praline topping.  Then in a 1-quart saucepan, boil sugar an water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage).  Stir in almonds; cook until mixture reaches 310 degrees F. or until syrup caramelizes.  Pour syrup into prepared baking pan.  When cool, break up praline and grind it in a blender for  few seconds. APRICOT GLAZE: Finally heat jam and press through a strainer or sieve to make apricot glaze. CAKE ASSEMBLY: To assemble cake, place bottom layer of cake on cake plate and spread with half of the butter cream.  Repeat with second layer.  Place third layer on top.  Spread top and sides of cake with apricot glaze.  Press praline powder onto glaze.  Any remaining butter cream can be used to decorate the top of the cake.

 Prepare cake mix as directed on package, baking in 13x9 inch pan.

 Remove from oven.  Poke holes at once down through the cake to the pan with the round handle of a wooden spoon (or poke holes with a plastic drinking straw, using a turning motion to make large holes).  Holes should be at 1" intervals.

 Only after poking holes, combine pudding mix with sugars and eggs in saucepan.  Gradually stir in water; add butter.  Cook and stir over medium heat until mixture comes to a full boil.

 Quickly, pour hot [pudding evenly over warm cake, into the holes to make the stripes and over the top to "frost" the cake.

 Chill at least 2 hours.

 Store cake in refrigerator.

This traditional holiday cake gets its name because there is just about 1 cup of batter too much in this recipe and it you pour it all into your tube pan without using the collar, it will go over the top and all over your oven! Put eggs in mixing bowl of electric mixer and beat at medium speed. Add remaining ingredients, except nuts, in order: sugar, brown sugar, oil, honey, coffee, flour, baking soda, baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and powdered cloves, while beating continuously. Fold nuts in last, reserving some to place on top. Make a 2 inch collar around the outside of a lightly oiled and floured tube pan and its inside circle. Pour in batter. Sprinkle remaining nuts on top. Bake at 335:, 45-55 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out dry. Allow to cool before removing from pan. You can also bake this cake in loaf pans cutting down on the baking time accordingly. Enjoy!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  butter -- softened
       2          cups  sugar
       3                eggs,large
       3          cups  flour,all-purpose -- sifted
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  buttermilk
       2   tablespoons  lemon peel,grated
       2   tablespoons  lemon juice,fresh
                        lemon icing:
     1/4           cup  butter -- softened
       2          cups  powdered sugar
   1 1/2   tablespoons  lemon peel,grated
     1/4           cup  lemon juice,fresh

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a very large bowl, cream butter (or margarine) until very light; slowly add sugar until mixture is very light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. In another bowl, sift flour, baking soda and salt together. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk to butter mixture. Begin and end with flour. Mix in lemon peel and juice. Pour batter into greased and floured 10-inch tube or 12-inch bundt pan. Bake for 65-75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Place pan on rack for 10 minutes to cool. Turn cake out of pan onto rack. Spread with as much lemon icing as the cake can absorb (about a third of the icing) Allow cake to cool completely then frost with remaining icing. ICING: Blend butter and sugar together in a medium bowl. Mix in peel and juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is of spreading consistency. If the entire amount of juice is used,  the icing will be thin and possibly difficult to spread evenly, however a very tangy frosting greatly enhances the flavor of the cake.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       5                eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  sugar
       6   tablespoons  water
   1 3/4          cups  cake flour -- sifted
       1      teaspoon  baking powder
   1 1/2          cups  hazelnuts (filberts) -- ground
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2   tablespoons  confectioners' sugar
       1           cup  heavy cream -- whipped
                        fresh strawberries

Beat the egg yolks and sugar until very light, about 5 minutes. Slowly add the water.  Sift the flour and baking powder together.  Mix with 1 cup of nuts.  Fold the flour mixture into the egg yolks.  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Gently fold the beaten whites into the batter.  Pour into a greased and floured 10-inch springform pan.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until cake is done. Cool cake on a wire rack.  When completely cooled, split the cake into 2 layers.  Fold the vanilla, confectioners' sugar, and remaining 1/2 cup of nuts into the whipped cream.  Spread whipped cream between the 2 cake layers and on top of the cake.  Chill until serving time. Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired. *  Hazelnuts are available at most stores under the name of Filberts. They should be blanched.  To blanch, boil the nuts for 5 minutes and when they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins.  To grind, place about 1/4 cup at a time in a blender, or chop as finely as you can with a sharp knife.

These individual chocolate cakes have a soft center of chocolate fudge that erupts in a rich, dark puddle from the warm cakes. They're best served just out of the oven. For the filling, line a plastic ice cube tray with a large piece of plastic wrap.  With your fingers, gently poke the plastic down into eight of the cubes so they are fully lined with plastic. Melt the chocolate with the cream and corn syrup; whisk until smooth. Add the vanilla, set aside to cool until tepid. Fill the eight lined ice cube cups with the chocolate; freeze at least 4 hours, or cover and freeze up to a month. For the cakes, place rack in center of oven and heat to 425:. Generously butter eight 4-ounce souffle dishes or ramekins. Place them on a jelly roll pan. Melt the chocolate with the coffee. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes, stir in vanilla. Cream the butter with 1/3 cup sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stop the mixer and stir in  the chocolate mixture. Fold in the flour and salt with a spatula. Beat the egg whites with a clean mixer until they hold soft peaks. Add the remaining sugar, one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue beating until thick and glossy. Thoroughly mix one quarter of the beaten egg whites into chocolate batter; gently fold in the rest. Fill each prepared souffle dish about halfway full with the chocolate batter. Gently bury a frozen chocolate cube in the center of each; add remaining batter, filling cups almost to the top. Bake until cakes are puffy and set, 18 to 20 minutes. Gently loosen from the sides of the dishes and invert onto serving plates. Sift cocoa over

Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt together into a mixing bowl. Make 3 wells in the dry ingredients. Pour vanilla into 1 well; vinegar into 1 well and melted butter into the third. Pour water over all. Beat with a wooden spoon until well blended. Pour batter into a greased 9" square baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350: oven for 25 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pan on rack. Frost with Mocha Chocolate Frosting. Cut into squares. MOCHA CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine confectioners' sugar, cocoa, softened butter, coffee, and vanilla in a mixing bowl. Beat, with an electric mixer set at medium speed, until smooth. NOTE; This recipe came from a very old church cookbook that the woman found and is typical of many of the recipes of the 1800's. The vinegar was used to keep the cake from spoiling. Try this and I think that you will like it.

Turn out immediately and remove the wax paper. Cool on racks top side up. Make thin slices when cool and start to frost with a cut side up and then keep layering. Cover the entire torte with the buttercream and then melt down semi sweet chocolate to melting point stirring well. Chill the cake and when firm pour over the dark chocolate making sure that the sides are covered. Chill to harden. Remove to new plate so drips are not seen. 

FROSTING: Mix sugar, water and cream of tartar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil over med heat for to 234 degree on candy thermometer. In a large bowl with a mixer beat the eggs until thick. Add the butter in small pieces and beat well. Combine chocolate and the coffee in a saucepan and heat gently until chocolate is melted and mixed. Add this and the vanilla to the bowl and beat well. If buttercream starts to not hold up refrigerate for a few mins and then beat again.

Spread 1/4" layer of chocolate mix on the bottom of pan. Top with a layer of graham crackers. Spread 1/4" of chocolate mix. Repeat this process 5 times. Spread remaining chocolate mix over top and sides. Wrap and chill for 2 hours or more until firm. To serve; remove torte from pan. Peel off plastic wrap. Smooth surface with knife dipped in hot water. Place on serving plate. Slices best after it has been at room temperature for 30 minutes.

CAKE:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 

In a small saucepan, combine mint-chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Cool 10 minutes. 

In medium bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; beat until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in chocolate mixture. Gradually beat in flour mixture alternately with remaining 1 cup of water. Pour into 2 greased and floured 9-inch round baking pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cakes test done. Cool completely on wire racks. Fill and frost with Chocolate Mint Frosting. Garnish as desired.

Combine over hot (not boiling) water, the mint-chocolate chips and butter. Stir until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in vanilla extract and salt. Transfer to a large bowl. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar alternately with milk; beat until smooth. (if necessary add more milk until desired consistency is reached.)

GARNISHES:
Use chocolate curls and grated chocolate on top of the cake. Form a ring of grated chocolate pieces around the outside edge and use the curls in the center. To make chocolate leaves, select several small leaves, wash and dry them and paint one side of them with melted chocolate. Chill until firm and peel the leaf off the chilled chocolate. Use as garnish.

                     Filled Berlin Doughnuts (Bismarks)

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : Breads                           Desserts                         
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  Active Dry Yeast
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  Bulk Active Dry Yeast
     1/4           cup  Warm Water -- (110-115 Deg F)
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/3           cup  Butter OR Regular Margarine
       1    tablespoon  Orange Juice
       2     teaspoons  Rum Extract
       1           cup  Milk -- scalded
                        Unbleached Flour -- up to 4 cups
       2         large  Eggs -- well beaten
                        Fat For Deep Frying -- heated to 375
                        degrees F
                        Jam OR Jelly

Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. 
Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl. Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes).
About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.
Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut. Force about 1/2 teaspoon of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

                     Fresh Cranberry Sauce

Recipe By     : Sous Chef Cleve
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2     teaspoons  cornstarch
       2   tablespoons  orange juice -- freshly squeezed
       2          cups  cranberries -- fresh
   1 1/2          cups  sugar
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated
       2     teaspoons  orange zest

Mix together the orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside. 

In a saucepan add the berries, water, sugar, spices, and orange zest. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes, or until the cranberries are tender. Return the mixture to a boil and add the orange juice and cornstarch slurry. Stir well while simmering for another 3 minutes or so.

This sauce is good warm or cold and can go in any number of directions from this point. Add a bit of fresh thyme and black pepper for a more savory version. For a dessert sauce, add other fruits, such as pears, or walnuts for crunch. Experiment and enjoy!

Description:
  "Okay, I know this is pretty basic, but hardly anyone makes it, and
  it's so much better than the canned stuff. Furthermore, it can be used
  in many ways besides just a sauce for the turkey."

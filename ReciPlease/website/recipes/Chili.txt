--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3        pounds  beef chuck or round steak
       2   tablespoons  cooking oil
       2                garlic coves -- minced
       4   tablespoons  chili powder
       2     teaspoons  ground cumin
       3   tablespoons  all purpose flour
       1    tablespoon  oregano
       3          cups  beef broth
     1/3      teaspoon  salt
       1          dash  ground pepper -- to taste
       1      15 ounce  ca  pinto or chili beans
       1       package  sour cream -- as needed
       2                lime -- as needed

ONE DAY IN ADVANCE: Cut the beef into 1-inch pieces. In a skillet heat oil to hot. Add beef.  Stir until color changes but does not brown. Lower heat, stir in garlic. Combine chili powder, cumin and flour. Sprinkle meat with chili mixture, stirring until meat is evenly coated. Crumble oregano over meat. Add 2 cups beef broth and stir until liquid is well blended. Add salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat; simmer partially covered over low heat for 1-1/2 hours. Add remaining broth and simmer 30 minutes longer. Meat should be almost falling apart. Cool well, refrigerate over night to "ripen" flavor. (This is most important.) Reheat on top of double-boiler.  Heat beans, drain, stir into chili. Serve on individual plates, adding a good dollop of sour cream. Squeeze lime juice over each portion. Cut the other lime into wedges and place a wedge onto each plate. Serve with hot corn bread and various fresh fruits.

Cook until Meat is browned but still soft. 2. Add tomato sauce, catsup, water and vinegar.  When mixture boils, add the rest of the salt,the remaining spices and herbs, the honey and chocolate. Adjust seasonings, adding more salt if it needs perking up, more cumin for a more strident chili flavor, more cinnamon and mace if you want it more aromatic, more cardamom for more band and more chocolate for more body. 3. Cover and simmer on very low heat for about 1 hour, stirring and tasting occasionally, adding tomato juice if it is getting too dry. It should be a thick sauce. Discard bay leaf. 4. For 5 way chili(use small oval plate if available), layer spaghetti on the plate, top it with chili, then with a sparse layer of kidney beans & then chopped, raw onions. Pat on the cheese while the chili is still hot and serve immediately, with oyster crackers on the side. You may, if desired, omit either the beans or onions, or both, for 3-way chili or 4-way chili.

Drain the fat and discard. Add the remaining ingredients, including the beans, and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, for 1 1/2 hours or until the beans are very tender. You may need to add water to the dish as it cooks. Now you must decide if you are to have it one, two, three, four or five way. You might even think up a sixth way! The additional condiments that you may want are cooked spaghetti, grated Cheddar cheese and chopped onions.

Break up any lumps with a fork and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned. Add this mixture to the pot~ 3. In a small plastic or paper bag, shake together the remaining 3 tablespoons of oregano, the woodruff, ground chile, cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, and the chipenos. Add the blended spices to the pot as well as the liquid hot pepper sauce, tomato sauce, and tomato paste.~ 4. Add enough water to cover.

                        chiles -- dried

1. Rinse, dry, and remove the stems, then crush or tear the dried chiles with your hands into little pieces (approximately 1/2 inch). Chile caribe can contain a portion of the seeds of the pepper.

                        -----crust-----

       1         pinch  salt
                        -----sauce-----
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
       4   tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter
   1 1/2     teaspoons  finely ground expresso -- coffee
                        ingredients:
       3      packages  ladyfingers
     1/2           cup  dark rum
   1 1/2        pounds  butter (no substitutes)
      27        ounces  semisweet chocolate chips

Cut beef into 1 inch chunks or thereabouts. Let beef soak in a bowl with the tomatoes and juice, lemon juice, mushrooms, black pepper, crushed chilis and onions over night. Brown the meat in a skillet. In large pot throw in the tomatoes and crushed chilis, onions, meat, paste, everything except the beans and peppers and slow cook for three hours. Next chop your green and red peppers into long slivers or if you prefer diced. Also stir in your beans and cook slowly for one more hour. All cooking must not have the lid on. With the thick "soupy" ring around the pot; stir back into the simmering chili.

 You might like the chili hotter or maybe milder, depends on your taste. What ever you do, don't ruin the chili by making it hotter with hot sauces, this has a tendency to make the chili into "superficial" body heat not a deep solid heat. To accompany the chili try and get your hands on some "Agua Dente" (fire water) 80% alcohol (national drink in Colombia). I guarantee you will see God!

Cut jerky into small, bite-sized pieces, remembering it will swell. In a heavy pot, simmer jerky and cumin seeds gently in moderately hot fat/oil for one to two minutes, stirring steadily to prevent burning. Add chili powder and continue to stir until well mixed. (Amount of chili powder will depend on the hotness of the jerky and your taste.)Add onion flakes, oregano, powdered cumin, garlic powder, and enough water to cover generously. Stir. Simmer one to two hours, adding water as the jerky takes it up. Allow chili to cool, and reheat before serving. If a thicker chili is preferred, add a little flour mixed to a paste with hot liquid from the pot and cook to desired consistency, stirring frequently.

Put turkey thighs on a chopping board; slice meat away from the bones. Cut meat in 1-inch cubes, discard skin. Spray a non-stick pot (or pressure cooker) with cooking spray for no-fat frying. Add cubed meat. Brown over moderate heat in its own melted fat (no added oil needed). Remove from flame and stir boiling water into juices in pot. Pour liquid into a cup, set aside until fat rises to surface. With a bulb-type baster, skim off and discard surface fat.  Return fat-skimmed liquid to pot. (Bones may be added for flavor and removed before serving.) Add all remaining ingredients except cheese.  Cover, simmer over low heat until tender, about 1 hour in conventional pot, or 20 minutes in pressure cooker. Uncover, continue to simmer until most of the liquid evaporates and chili is thick. Top with cheese.

Canned beans cannot be used in this recipes; the cooking liquid from the dry beans makes a rich, flavorful broth that forms the base for the chili. If you soak the beans overnight you can cut the cooking time in half. Freeze any leftover chili for a fast meal later. Serve over brown rice (make 3/4 cup per serving extra rice for tomorrow's breakfast). Place the beans and water in a large pot.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours.  Add the remaining ingredients and cook an additional 2 hours.

       1           can  tomato sauce (large can)
     1/4           cup  red wine

Hint: to test chili pod's heat, take a small nibble of dry chili in your mouth, when cooked, it will about double in strength. Brown hamburger meat in large skillet. While browning, make chili paste. Take 6-8 dried chili pods, remove some seeds, leave some in for flavor. Remove stems. Put in blender with about 1/2 cup warm water or so just enough to make a paste. Too wet will be difficult. When hamburger meat is browned, drain fat. Add chili paste, oregano, cumin and garlic cloves. Add salt to taste. Brown mixture well, Don't burn!Add 4 tablespoons of flour. Brown this, immediately remove from heat. In another large saucepan, add tomato sauce and red wine. Add browned mixture. Simmer,simmer,simmer(3 hours or more) you can do this in s slow cooker. Thin if necessary, salt to taste, adjust cumin and oregano as needed, these flavors strengthen with cooking(cumin tends to add a sweet hint of taste.)Salt enhances all flavors Hint: buy more tomato sauce than you need, if chili is TOO hot when done, add more tomato sauce. Serve with sour cream, grated mild cheddar cheese or whatever you like.Hint: drink iced tea with chili,it's the best beverage for hot mouth!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6                chiles -- (6 to 12)
       3           cup  cold water
       1       package  soy or textured vegetable protein -- (12oz)
       2   tablespoons  oil
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
       1    tablespoon  cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper
       1    tablespoon  paprika
      12           cup  water

Wash, stem and remove seeds from the chilies.  Put chilies in 3 cups cold water and bring to a boil.
After about 45 minutes to an hour the skins should slip off easily.  Mash the pulp into a paste.  If this
seems too difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of 1 tablespoon chili powder to a pod of
chili. Read the instructions on the soy or TVP package to see if the product was soaked beforehand.  If not, use some of the water to prepare this ingredient.  

Saute the onions in the olive oil until translucent.  Add the garlic and spices , then the 12 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to an hour.  If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal flour used in tortillas.  When made in bulk, this chili can readily be frozen.

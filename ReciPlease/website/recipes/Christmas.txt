                        shredded coconut

Combine corn syrup, sugar and butter in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Stir constantly.  Continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and add a few drops of food coloring at a time until the mixture is about the color green that you want.  Remember, you are trying to simulate the color of a Christmas evergreen wreath.

Now stir the warm syrup into the dry corn flakes.  Stir until well combined.  Now drop by the teaspoons onto waxed paper.  You want to make little round wreaths.  They can be as small as an inch or you can use all the mixture and make one huge wreath to use as a centerpiece-dessert.

Decorate you wreaths with cinnamon candies to look life ornaments or holly berries. You also may sprinkle on shredded coconut to look life snowy branches.  Let cool to harden.

Yield":  This will depend on what size wreaths you make.  You might get one big one or lots of tiny ones.

     1/2           cup  quartered red glazed cherries -- and/or green
     1/2           cup  minced pecans or walnuts

Combine the egg nog, sugar, corn syrup, and salt in a stainless steel or enamel saucepan.  The pan should hold at least 2 1/2 quarts to allow for boiling and beating.

Cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage (about 235 degrees) and forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water.

At this point cool the sugar mixture to lukewarm, add the butter and begin beating.  This is an important step in the recipe.  If possible have someone to help with the beating because beating must be kept up until the candy loses its gloss (when it crystallizes).

Just as the candy begins to lose its gloss, stir in the cherries and nuts and spread into a buttered pie dish.  This must be done quickly or the candy will set in the pan.

Cool and cut into squares.

 Before icing sets, decorate tops as desired.

Prepare Almond Filling: Combine almond paste with 1 egg white. Beat with fork until blended. Stir in chopped, blanched almonds, toasted.
Punch dough down. On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 9- W 16-inch rectangle. Spread filling to within 1/2-inch of edges; sprinkle with cherries. Roll up from long side as for jelly roll; pinch seam to seal. Form into ring and pinch ends to seal. Place ring, seam side down, on greased baking sheet. With sharp knife, cut slits, 3/4 through dough, at 1-inch intervals. Turn each section on its side. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.

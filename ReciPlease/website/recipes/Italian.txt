     1/4         pound  ham -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  provolone cheese -- sliced
     1/8         pound  coppacola (spicy italian -- ham) thinly sliced
       2                sweet red peppers, roasted -- peeled and sliced
       2        ounces  pepperoncinis -- drained and
                        (6            - 8)

       1                egg white
                        cornmeal

For the Pizza Dough Soften the yeast in the water. Stir in the oil, then the flour and salt. Knead dough on a floured board until smooth and elastic (about 20 minutes). Shape into a round ball, cover with plastic and refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Shape the pizza dough into a ball and then roll out into a large oval shape (about 24 inches long). About 2 inches behind the front edge, spread the pesto in a long stripe, stopping just short of the ends. Just behind and overlapping the pesto, place a layer of the ham slices, then a layer of cheese then the coppacolla, peppers and pepperoncini. You should still have about 2 inches of dough showing at the back edge. Beat the egg and brush on the back edge and ends of the dough. Roll up Calzone as firmly as possible (so no air gets inside). Tuck the ends in and finish with the back edge on the bottom, not on the side. Place on a baking sheet pan sprinkled with corn meal, brush with egg white and bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature and slice.  Can be sliced thin for appetizers NOTE: To roast peppers, preheat broiler.  Slice the peppers in half lengthwise. Core them and remove the seeds and ribs. Lay the pieces skin side up on a flat broiling pan and place the pan 3 - 4 inches below the heat.  Broil the peppers until the skins are charred (they should be black).  Then place the peppers in a plastic bag, seal it with a twist tie and set aside.  Let peppers steam in the bag for 15 minutes. Remove the peppers from the bag and slip off the charred skins.

       1    tablespoon  oil from sun-dried tomatoes
       1        medium  onion -- finely chopped
       1         clove  garlic -- minced
                        or pressed
       1           cup  (8 oz) ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  chopped sun-dried tomatoes
       2   tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
     1/4         pound  sliced prosciutto or dry

                        cornmeal (for baking sheet)
                        olive oil

1. Prepare Deep-Dish Pizza Dough and let it rise. 2. While dough rises, prepare filling. In a medium frying pan heat tomato oil over moderate heat; add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft but not browned. Mix in garlic, then remove from heat. 3. In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese with dried tomatoes and parsley; stir in cooked onion mixture. 4. Divide dough into two equal portions. Roll each half out on a floured surface to a 12-inch circle. Spread half of the ricotta filling over half of each circle of dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch margin. 5. Sprinkle half of each circle with half of the prosciutto strips and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese.

Place in large mortar with garlic & mash with pestle until a fine paste.  Add the yolks & salt & mash in. Drop by drop pound in olive oil.  When the sauce becomes thick; the remaining oil may be beaten in. Thin with water & lemon juice to taste. FROM: PAM HOUGLAN (KFNR49B)

       2    tablespoon  olive oil
       1                lemon -- juiced

Put the cod in a deep dish, add cold water to cover, and let it soak for 2 days in the refrigerator in order for it to "plump" up and change the water several times. Rinse and dry the fish and cut it into 2-inch chunks. Dredge the fish in the flour, shaking off the excess. In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbl of the butter and the olive oil. Add the fish pieces and brown them well on all sides over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the fish with the minced garlic and parsley and stir the mixture gently. Cut the remaining 2 Tbl butter into bits and add it to the pan. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and pour over the lemon juice. Serve immediately.

Pound the slices of meat as thin as possible. Make a mixture of bread crumbs, egg and oil. Lay meat out and lightly salt and pepper each piece. Place some of the mixture on each piece and spread covering most of the meat except the edges. Roll and secure with a toothpick. Lightly brown each in a bit of butter and oil. When browned place in oven proof dish. To the browning pan add tomato sauce and mix to get all flavor from bottom of pan. Pour over meat and bake in oven at 350 for 45 min. Turn often to prevent drying.

 Serving suggestions.... Mashed potatoes..with a touch of garlic while mashing. The sauce makes a wonderful tasty gravy. A bright veg such as carrots or broccoli. Crust bread and a salad.

Cut proscuitto to fit each beef slice and place over peppers.  Sprinkle with basil leaves, Parmesan and pepper. Roll tightly and tie in two places with kitchen twine to secure, or use toothpicks. Combine all marinade ingredients and pour over beef rolls in non-reactive pan. Let set at room temp for an hour, or refrigerate for several hours. Remove from marinade, reserving marinade.  Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in large heavy skillet.  Brown beef rolls on all sides. Add marinade and simmer for 20 minutes.  Or you can put into tightly covered baking dish and bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  Adapted from a recipe by Della Masia ().

     3/4      teaspoon  active dry yeast
       3    tablespoon  Bertolli light olive oil
       1           cup  warm water

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Combine flour, salt, yeast and water in bowl. Blend well, turn out onto floured surface. Knead well, about 15 minutes. Place in lightly greased bowl, not buttered, cover with a damp cloth and let rise for 1-1/2 hours (until doubled in bulk). Turn dough out, punch down and knead for 5 minutes or so. Return to bowl and let rise until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out on lightly floured board. Roll and press out to about 1/2 inch thickness. This recipe makes about 1-12 inchers-so you can judge whether to double or reduce the recipe. Rub surface of baking (cookie) sheet with oil and transfer the dough round to the sheet.  Make several indentations with the point of a knife in the dough and insert garlic slices and rosemary into indentations.Rub olive oil (pour) onto surface and gently smooth over the surface. Salt and pepper surface LIGHTLY.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until just golden. Remove from oven and TAKE OUT THE GARLIC SLIVERS! You can now top the crust, freeze it, eat it the way it is, smile at it (YOU DID IT!) Remember, when you top it the crust is already 2/3 baked and will require only enough time so that the cheeses, etc. are bubbly. Formatted for MM by Norma Wrenn

       3    tablespoon  oregano -- fresh or 1 t dried

Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub the chicken pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep china or earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook, preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted butter mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over the chicken when served.)  Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for 5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to serving platter, pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and serve immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.

       2         pound  chicken; breasts, thighs -- a
       8         ounce  italian dressing -- ( i used
  14 1/2         ounce  tomato wedges -- drained
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
       6         ounce  mushrooms -- sliced drained

       8         ounce  linguine
      14         ounce  artichoke hearts -- drained a

Place chicken in a lightly greased 12x8x2" baking dish (Pam works great). Arrange tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, and artichokes on top. Combine salad dressing and wine; pour over vegetables and chicken. Sprinkle with the onion soup mix.  Cover and bake @ 350 for 1 hr.or until the chicken is done.  Meanwhile cook the linguine. When the chicken is done, spoon the juice and vegetables over the pasta and top with the chicken. ( Southern Living, Sept. 1991) I bet this would be great made ahead and letting the chicken marinade in the dressing and wine. It was good and good for you. Hope you enjoy.

     1/4           cup  butter
                        grated cheese

Heat half the butter in a pan. When it melts add the flour. When it begins to bubble add the milk and mix well. Cook on low for 5 min. It will start to thicken. Mix often to avoid lumping and sticking. Cut all the cheese into small strips. Gradually add the cheese mixing well while it melts into a velvety sauce. Season with salt and pepper and serve over hot, cooked pasta of your choice. Top with grated cheese. **You may vary some of the cheeses, but never the Fontina. That is the essential flavor.

       1      teaspoon  chopped fresh oregano
       1    tablespoon  butter
                        salt
       1    tablespoon  flour
       1                tomato -- seeded and peeled

IL TIMBALLO DI MELANZANE CON PREA DI POMODORO (Drago's Eggplant Souffle in Tomato-Basil Sauce)  Peel eggplants, cut into cubes and set aside. Cut whole zucchini into quarters. Remove centers and discard. Cut remaining zucchini into cubes and set aside. Repeat process with pepper and set aside.

 Heat oil in saute pan, add eggplant cubes, potato, onion, basil and oregano and season to taste with salt. Saute until golden. Add tomato and cook approximately 10 minutes.

 Pour eggplant mixture into food processor and blend until smooth. Add Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs and eggs into processor and blend 5 seconds.

 Lace 8 (6-ounce) timbals with butter. Cover bottom of cup with chopped zucchini and pepper and fill rest of cup with processed eggplant mixture. Cook in bain marie at 350 degrees 40 minutes.

 Remove timbales from oven and let standing warm place 15 minutes.

 When ready to serve, spoon small amount Tomato-Basil Sauce on individual serving plates, then flip souffle cups onto top of each plate. Serve warm. Makes 8 servings.

 Drago serves these individual souffles as appetizers at his restaurant. It's a wonderful use of eggplant, one of the most commonly used vegetables in Sicily. It's essential that you use good Parmesan- the cheese is what rounds out the flavor.

 For Tomato-Basil Sauce:

 Place olive oil and onion in saucepan and saute until golden. Add tomatoes, basil and season to taste with salt. Cook 10 minutes on low heat.

 Melt butter in separate pan, add flour and mix well. Add butter- flour mixture to tomato sauce and cook few more minutes. Remove basil leaves from sauce and blend sauce in blender until smooth and creamy. Makes 2 cups.

   1 1/2         pound  ground beef
       4         ounce  cheddar cheese -- grated
       1                onion -- chopped

       6         ounce  pepperoni -- sliced
      12         ounce  noodles
                        mushrooms
                        green peppers

Brown meat and onion. Drain grease. Add sauces. Simmer. Boil noodles till al dente; drain. You do not want the noodles to be soft. In crock pot, put a layer of sauce, noodles, meat/sauce mixture, cheeses, pepperoni and as much mushrooms and green peppers as desired. Original recipe I had said to repeat layers one more time, but I repeated layers a few times more. Cook on high for 30 minutes and then on low for 1 hour ( I cooked on low for 2 hours), or until cheese melts. Can be made in a deep casserole dish in the oven at 350:F until cheese melts.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4    tablespoon  butter
                        freshly ground black pepper
     1/2         pound  mushrooms -- thinly sliced

       2           cup  tomatoes; peeled -- diced
       4                loin veal chops -- 1" thick
     1/2           cup  prosciutto ham -- julienne cut
       4    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
       3    tablespoon  parsley -- minced
                        salt to taste

Melt butter in saucepan; saute mushrooms for 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, ham, wine salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil, lower heat and cook for 5 minutes. Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. Heat 2 T. olive oil in skillet; brown chops on both sides. Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper large enough to completely fold over each chop. Brush the paper with remaining oil. Place a chop in center of each piece of parchment and cover with the sauce. Sprinkle each chop with parsley. Fold over the paper, sealing the edges well. Place on a baking sheet; bake in a 375F oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve in the paper with the top rolled back. Note: I usually place the parchment packages on a large wooden carving board and bring it to the table. You can either snip open the packages with scissors or carefully with a sharp knife. I like to remove the contents onto the dinner plate. Fried zucchini sticks go very well with this dish. Enjoy.

                        colored sprinkles
       2           cup  all-purpose flour

Whisk together:  eggs, butter, 1 tsp sugar until foamy. Add baking powder; add flour.  Work the mixture into a soft dough with your hands. Divide dough into 4 pieces.  On a floured surface, roll each piece into a rope about the width of your index finger and 12 inches long. Cut the ropes into 1" pieces.  Toss the pieces with enough flour to dust them lightly and shake off excess flour. Heat oil to 375F in a deep fryer. Fry the struffoli a few handfuls at a time until they puff up and are golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel to drain. Combine the honey and the 1/2 cups sugar in a large saucepan over low heat; stirring until the sugar has dissolved; keep warm over low heat. Add the fried balls, a few at a time, and turn them with a wooden spoon to coat on all sides. Transfer the balls to a large platter and mound them into a pyramid, shaping with wet hands. Sprinkle with the colored sprinkles and let stand for 1 to 2 hours.  Then just break off some pieces with your hands to eat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         pound  italian sausage
                        (hot/sweet/both)
       1         pound  green bell peppers
     3/4         pound  spanish onions
      30    milliliter  garlic
     1/2         pound  canned mushrooms
       3           cup  italian tomato sauce

Fry sausage until 3/4 cooked (about 15 minutes). Remove. Cut and core peppers and slice into strips. Peel and slice onions into strips. Fry pepper strips in sausage grease add oil if not enough grease. Fry about 5 minutes; add onions and continue frying. Chop garlic and add mushrooms and fry about 5 minutes. Add sausage and sauce and simmer on low until meat is hot, about 10 minutes. I usually serve this as a "hot" dish in a hot and cold buffet. It can serve as a main dish with a side of pasta or rice. Also makes a great hot sandwich on Italian bread, or great pocket sandwich on syrian (pita) bread. It also makes great table art when you drop it on a white tablecloth (smile). Its a very versitle dish can substitute with any kind of meat. Enjoy!

       2           cup  small peas (1# can)

Cut the veal into 8 slices.  Place the slices between sheets of wax paper and pound thin.  Sprinkle with four on one side only. Place half of the slices, floured sides down, on a working board. Spoon some of the butter (about 2 tablespoons) over the slices and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.  Place 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of proscuitto over each veal slice and again spoon some butter lightly over them. Add half a leaf of the sage.  Chop garlic and parsley together and divide the mixture among the 4 veal slices. Arrange the shaved truffles on top. (Use more truffles if you wish.)  Add the remaining veal slices, floured sides up. Press the edges together with a knife handle. Spoon more of the butter over.

 Reserve 1 tablespoon of the butter; place the rest in a skillet and heat. Add the little bundles and saute for 5 minutes, until brown. Turn, cook for 3 minutes longer, and baste. Pour the wine over the veal, shake the skillet, baste again, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.

 Dice the remaining slices of prosciutto.  Place peas in a small pan and heat.  Drain.  Add diced prosciutto and the reserved tablespoon of butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat for a few minutes. Arrange saltimbocca on warm plates, spoon all of the sauce over, and serve with the peas.  Drink the rest of the Frascati.

 *NOTE:  If using dried sage, soak it in warm water for a few minutes and press dry before using.  For this dish do not use ground sage.

       4            md  yellow and red bell peppers
       2    tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
      18                garlic cloves -- sliced
     1/4           cup  plus 1-1/2 teaspoons
                        balsamic vinegar
       2        sprigs  fresh thyme or
     1/4      teaspoon  dried
       6         ounce  fresh mozzarella cheese
                        sliced as thin as possible
     1/4           cup  coarsely chopped flat-leaf
                        parsley or fresh basil
                        freshly ground black pepper

1.  Roast the bell peppers directly over a gas flame or under the broiler as close to the heat as possible, turning, until charred all over, about 5 minutes. Enclose the peppers in a paper bag and set aside for 10 minutes to steam.  With a small knife, scrape off the blackened skin; remove the cores, seeds and ribs. Rinse under running water. Slice the peppers lengthwise into 1-inch strips.  (The recipe can be prepared to this point up to 3 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) 2. In a small nonreactive skillet, combine the olive oil and garlic. Cover and cook over very low heat until the garlic is very tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Uncover the pan, increase the heat to moderate and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and thyme and cook for 1 minute. 3. To assemble, decoratively arrange the pepper strips and mozzarella slices on 6 small plates.  Spoon the caramelized garlic dressing over the peppers and cheese and sprinkle the parsley and black pepper on top. Serve at room temperature.  (The salad can be assembled up to 2 hours before serving.)

       2           cup  arborio rice (15 ounces)
       4         ounce  fontina cheese
       5         ounce  gorganzola cheese
       6           cup  chicken stock (or 3 cups

                        canned chicken broth and

                        grated parmesan cheese
                        grated pecorino cheese

Peel and mince the onion.  Cut the fontina and Gorganzola cheeses into 1/4-inch dice (1 cup each).  Bring the chicken stock (or chicken broth and water) to a boil; cover and keep warm.  Heat 4 tablespoons butter in a large soup kettle.  Add the onions and saute until softened, about 4 minutes.  Stir in rice and saute until translucent and coated with butter, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup hot stock and, stirring continuously, simmer until liquid is completely absorbed, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining stock, stirring continuously, adding 1/2 cup at a time. Add more stock only after previous addition has been absorbed. Continue to cook, stirring and adding hot stock, until rice is creamy and just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining butter, cheeses, and pepper. Serve immediately. Makes 4 to 6 servings. BASIC RISOTTO:  Use the same recipe except increase the butter to 1/4 pound, increase the Parmesan cheese to 6 tablespoons and omit the other three cheeses [COOKS; APRIL 1989] Posted by Fred Peters.

       3                eggs
     1/2        medium  onion -- chopped
       1                tomato sauce for color
       1                salt & pepper to taste
       3    tablespoon  grated cheese
       1                garlic powder to taste
       1                garlic powder to taste
     1/4           cup  peas
       1                salt, pepper -- parsley

Wash and drain rice.  Boil water in saucepan over high heat. Add the drained rice and bring to a boil.  Stir once, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente and slightly sticky, about 17 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes.  Add the chopped meat and seasoning and saute until the meat just loses its raw color, about 5 minutes longer. Add the tomato sauce and peas and cook until the liquid evaporates and the peas are just tender, about 10 minutes longer for fresh peas, or about 5 minutes for thawed. In a mixing bowl, beat 2 of the eggs. Add the cooled rice and the grated cheese and seasonings.  Scoop about 3 Tbl of the rice mixture into the palm of one hand (wet hands first) and press it out to form and even round. Place about 1/2 Tbl of the meat mixture and one small chunk mozzarella in the center of the patty, then gently close your hand to encase the filling in the rice. Use both hands to roll the stuffed rice into a ball. Continue making balls until all ingredients are used. Beat the remaining 1-2 eggs in a small bowl and pour the bread crumbs into a small bowl. Roll each rice ball in the egg to coat completely, then roll  in the bread crumbs to cover well. Set aside until all balls are coated. Pour oil in a deep fryer or saucepan to a depth of 4 inches. Heat to 360F. Carefully drop the rice balls, a few at a time, into oil and fry, turning frequently, until golden brown all around, about 5 minutes. With a slotted utensil, transfer to paper toweling to drain. If desired, place in a low oven to keep warm until all are cooked. Serve warm.

       2           cup  tomato sauce
                        bread crumbs (optional)

Here's a vegetarian main dish that I quite liked.  Granted, it's not the melanzana parmasana I enjoyed in Naples it is quite tasty on it's own merits. Note: My variations are in (). TM- I enjoyed this recipes.  Will try it with the bread crumbs next time. (Peel and) Slice the eggplant lengthwise into 1/2" (1/4") slabs. Brush both sides of all pieces with olive oil.  Arrange (in 9x13" pan) on a cookie sheet. Bake at 400F for 15 min.  Set aside. Place pinto beans or chick-peas (I used the chick peas, next time I'd mash all of them as the whole pea texture was not exactly what I had in mind) into a bowl or dish. Mash about half of them with a fork. Set aside. In a large frying pan, saute the onions in 1T oil until soft.  Add the mushrooms (I used a 4 1/2oz can, drained) and garlic.  Cook until the liquid that the mushrooms have released has evaporated.  Set aside. Crumble the cheese, set aside. (I used shredded mild cheddar and shredded Mozzarella/Provolone mix - it was what I had in the fridge.) Slice the zucchini lengthwise into 1/4" slabs.  Steam for 7 min, then drain on a cotton towel.  (I nuked mine for about 4 min total) Set aside. To assemble, oil a 9x13" baking dish.  Arrange the eggplant slices in 1 layer in the bottom. Cover with the beans.  Sprinkle beans with half the oregano (another substitution - baby started crying so since Italian seasoning was the only one close at hand used that instead of oregano - next time I'll try it with just oregano as suggested.) Then spread on the mushroom mixture, and top it with a layer of cheese. Sprinkle cheese with remaining oregano. Layer on the zucchini, then cover with tomato sauce (here I used Ragu garden with mushroom) and crumbs. Bake at 350F for 45 min.  Allow to stand for 10 min before cutting into squares and serving. Note:  You can assemble the casserole and refrigerate until ready to bake.  Bake at 350F for 35 min. If you omit the cheese, serve with a nut or seed dessert for added protein.

Using a vegetable peeler, remove a strip of zest from one of the oranges and chop enough to measure 1/4 tsp. Using a knife, peel skin and pith from oranges and cut in between the membranes to remove the sections. Using hands, lightly crush the basil sprigs and toss in a large bowl with the orange sections.  Cover and chill 2-6 hours. Mince the 1/2 cup basil. In a medium bowl combine the egg yolks, sugar, wine and reserved orange zest. Place over a saucepan of simmering water and whisk until the zabaglione is frothy, thick, and doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced basil.  Drain the orange sections and remove basil sprigs. Divide among 3 dessert dishes and spoon a heaping tablespoon of zabaglione over each one.

My own creation.  Clean 2lbs. mussels in H2O & lots of black pepper for an hour & then drain. Clean beards off mussels. In a large pan, saute garlic in 2 tbls of olive oil, slow heat. Add basil leaves, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes,  parsley,>> onions, mushrooms and green pep- pers.  Everything should be fresh,esp mushrooms & add ingredientes to taste. I add a lot because I love full flavors. Saute for 15 minutes and then add 2- 1 lb cans or larger, of peeled tomatoes. Break the tomatoes with  your hands &  blend.  Cover and simmer for 1 hour,  stirring frequently. Add 2 fresh, diced tomatoesand cook for another 10-15 min longer. Add 1/4-1/2cup of dry red wine &cook for another 10 minutes. Don't over-heat, don't dry up the  sauce.  I love my sauces watery as you seem to. Adjust seasonings  to taste as you go. Use freshly grated parmasan AND romano cheese for the top- ping &add all on top of cooked pasta. Add fresh pepper- black &/or red. Serve with a DARK green salad and serve with a slightly chilled Chianti red wine. Add candle light and with Classical guitar in the background makes quite an evening.  I hope you can adjust the seasonings to your lik- ing because that's how I cook-according to my taste.  I get rave reviews for my cuisian so it can work. Enjoy!

       1         quart  white vinegar
       1           cup  extra virgin olive oil
       3           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  chopped garlic
       1      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
       1    tablespoon  dried oregano or
   2 1/2                fresh oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

1. Slice the skins off the eggplants, and slice them about 1/4 inch thick from top to bottom. Then slice across to get pieces the size of French fries. Put the eggplant strips in a bowl and toss with the 1/2 cup of salt. 2. Move the eggplant strips into a colander, arraying them in a relatively uniform layer up the sides. Put a bowl the same size as the colander inside the colander and weigh it down with three or so pounds of weight. [I find a foil covered common solid brick is a handy kitchen tool] Put the entire apparatus in the sink to drain for 45 minutes. This will remove any bitterness from the eggplant. 3. Rinse the salt off the eggplant with cold water. Drain it well, then SQUEEZE it dry. Put the eggplant in a bowl with the vinegar, and marinate it for 30 minutes. [It will return to shape like a wet sponge] 4. Drain the vinegar from the eggplant and squeeze it dry again. Put the eggplant into a bowl with all the other ingredients. 5. Pour the contents into a canning jar. Make SURE therre is enough olive oil to completely cover all the eggplant about 1/2 inch deep. Tightly seal and refrigerate the jar. Marinate for at least a week; the ideal time is actually three months, and the eggplant will keep getting better even after that.

       1         pound  ground chuck
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
       1         pound  ground pork

   1 1/2           cup  bread crumbs*
                        fresh basil leaves***

* Or enough to hold the mixture together. Try to use leftover French or Italian bread, and whole wheat crumbs work well also. ** Chopped very fine *** If you have them on hand (GrandMa Rose always adds fresh basil) YIELD: 15-18 medium meatballs, or 40-45 tiny meatballs. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently with your hands until the meat has become thoroughly blended with all the seasonings. The mixture should be farily moist. 2.  To form the meatballs, wet your hands in a small bowl of lukewarm water and then pick up about 1/3 cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it in the palm of your hands to form a smooth ball about 1 inch in diameter. 3.  Drop the meatballs directly into your basic tomato sauce recipe. Or, if you prefer a crusty meatball, fry in approximately 3 tablespoons of olive oil on med heat for about 5 min, turning to brown evenly.  Then drop them into gently boiling tomato sauce as they are browned. Meatballs take about 20 min to cook well. (Remember to scrape the bottom of skillet and pour meat particles into sauce.)

In a large pot, place the meat, water, salt, small onion, celery leaves and bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for about 2-1/2 hours until the meat is tender. Remove the meat.  Strain the broth (should measure 2 quarts). Add ice cubes to the broth to harden the fat and remove the fat.  Discard the fat. Finely dice the meat, discarding any fat and bones (should be about 2 cups). In a 5 to 6 quart kettle or Dutch oven, combine the beef broth and the meat. Place over low heat while preparing the remaining ingredients. Pan fry the bacon until crisp.  Add the bacon and the drippings and all the remaining ingredients, except the Parmesan cheese, to the broth. Cover and simmerfor about 30 minutes, until the vegetables and macaroni are tender. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired. From: "International cooking with Coca-Cola", a give-away pamphlet from the Coca-Cola Company, 1981.

       4    tablespoon  olive oil
                        salt and pepper to taste

Parboil the tripe for about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, cut into strips about 1"by 3". Saute onion in butter and olive oil. When they are golden add the rest of the ingredients andmix well. Simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender. If needed, add a bit more water at the end to make just a bit of sauce to soak up with some good crusty bread. Serve hot with grated cheese on the side. Don`t forget the bread. Variation: with a few minor adjustments, you can use this as a pasta sauce. Cut the tripe a bit smaller and add about 4 more oz of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of dry wine, white or red. This will give you more sauce for the spaghetti. Don`t forget to adjust the salt and pepper.

       4           cup  broccoli flowerttes

     1/3           cup  olive oil
                        salt & pepper -- to taste

Saute garlic in olive oil until JUST beginning to brown. DO NOT allow garlic to brown. At the FIRST sight of browning the garlic is finished. Any more cooking will make the garlic bitter. Add broccoli & toss to coat, then add this mixture to the hot, drained pasta and toss to mix completely. Season w/salt & pepper to taste & enjoy!

Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  flour -- whole wheat pastry
       1           cup  flour -- unbleached
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2                eggs -- large
       2      teaspoon  olive oil
       2    tablespoon  water -- more as necessary

Sift together the flours and salt and pour out on a clean, dry board. Shape into a mound, then make a well in the center with the "walls" of the flour even all around.  Crack the eggs into the well and add the oil. Using a fork, mix the flour together with the egg mixture, keeping the "well" intact by cupping one hand around the wall of flour while you brush flour from the top of the wall into the well, incor-porating it into the egg mixture.  The mixture of eggs and flour will get very sticky; keep incorporating flour with the fork while you con-tinue to confine the flour with your other hand so it doesn't scatter itself all over the working surface.  (You won't be able to get all the flour incorporated, and some flakes of the mixture won't be absorbed, but don't be concerned with this small amount---you'll have plenty of pasta.)  When you have incorporated all the flour you can into the egg mixture, sprinkle with the water.  This may make the mixture sticky. Sprinkle with a little more flour---just a little---so you can handle the dough, and mix the dough vigorously with your hands.  When the dough is smooth and elastic, knead it for 5 minutes.  Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in a damp towel, and let rest for 0 minutes to an hour.

 Divide the dough into eight. Roll out as thin as possible---start at the thickest setting your machine allows, and run each piece through many times, each time setting the machine one notch thinner.  The dough will shrink back a little, so roll it thinner than you  PRODIGY(R) interactive personal service         09/20/93         7:10 PM  want it. Run through the cutters, or cut with a knife into the desired shapes, and place on waxed paper until ready to cook.  If storing, allow to dry and  wrap in plastic. Keep in a cool, dry place.

Saute in shrimp butter. Cook the pasta in a 4-quart pot of boiling water, adding the salt and oil. Cook a few minutes or until the pasta is al dente. (The pasta will continue to cook as you make the sauce, so don't overcook.) Drain. Heat an 11" saucepan. Add the butter, shallots and garlic. Cook until translucent. Add shrimp and scallops and simmer for one minute. Add cream. Reduce heat to simmer. Add pasta and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, tossing occasionally, until  shellfish and pasta are al dente. Garnish with parsley and serve. NOTE: If using fresh fettuccine, cook only one to two minutes. Packaged noodles may take eight to twelve minutes. The starch from the pasta helps to bind this delicious sauce. May be served as an entree.

Place clams and 1/4 cup water in a large heavy pan. Cover and simmer just until clams pop open (5 to 10 minutes). When cool enough to handle, remove clams from shells and set aside (save a few clams in shells for garnish, if you wish). Strain clam broth through a piece of dampened muslin to remove grit; reserve broth.  Cook linguine in a large kettle of boiling salted water according to package directions until al dente; drain well.  While linguine cooks, place butter and oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat.  When butter is melted, add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft.  Mix in garlic, wine, and strained clam broth.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook until liquid is reduced by about half.  Add clams, season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in parsley.  Arrange linguine on a warm serving platter.  Spoon hot sauce over linguine. Garnish with reserved clams in shells, if you wish.

       4         pound  spaghetti
       4                garlic -- squashed
       1    tablespoon  season-all
       4                tomatoe paste -- 6 oz cans
                        parmesan cheese -- grated
       1                onion -- finely chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  msg
       1         quart  water

Long, slow simmering of meat and herbs produces the base for this incomparable sauce. Season roast with salt; dredge with flour. In Dutch oven brown slowly on all sides in hot olive oil. Add hot water; cover and cook slowly 3 hours or until meat almost falls apart. Tear into small pieces with fork.  Add remaining ingredients except spaghetti and cheese. Cover tightly and simmer 2 hours longer, stirring occasionally. Remove cover and continue cooking until sauce thickens to desired consistency. Cook spaghetti following directions on package, allowing 1 pound for 4 servings.  Ladle sauce over spaghetti. Top with cheese. Makes about 3 1/2 quarts sauce, enough for 4 pounds spaghetti. NOTE: Since you may not need such a large quantity of spaghetti, freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint or quart freezer jars and use as needed. I prefer to use rump roast, but chuck or round is acceptable.

     1/2           cup  bread crumbs
       1           can  (12 oz.) tomato paste
     1/2           cup  parmesan -- grated
       2           can  (12 oz.) water

For the sauce: Empty tomato puree into an 8-qt. non-aluminum kettle. Fill the two empty cans with water and add to puree. In a blender, add another 1/4 can water, one seeded green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic. Blend or process until liquified. Add to tomato puree. Add anise, 2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 Tbsp. basil, 1 Tbsp. oregano and 1 Tbsp. parsley. Bring to a boil and simmer. Prepare meat: Thoroughly brown ribs on all sides. Turn off the heat. Do not drain fat. Transfer ribs to a bowl and set aside. Combine ground beef and sausage. In a blender, process eggs, garlic clove, seeded green pepper and add to ground beef mixture. Add remaining spices, bread crumbs and Parmesan. Mix well. Roll into meatballs. Brown thoroughly and set aside with ribs. Pour tomato paste into the same skillet used to brown meat. On high temperature, stirring constantly for one to two minutes, scorch bottom of skillet until some of the paste sticks and turns black. Add the two 12-oz. cans of water, scraping the bottom of the skillet to loosen scorched paste. (This gives the sauce a deep, rich color and flavor.) Add this mixture to the already simmering sauce. Add ribs and meatballs. Continue simmering the sauce for a minumum of three hours, stirring occasionally. For best results, refrigerate after cooking and reheat the next day.

       2      teaspoon  olive oil
       2                eggs
       2    tablespoon  water

Saute the onion and pepper. Cook pasta and drain. Add pepper, onion and bacon Add 2 eggs and stir over med heat until egg starts to cook. You don't want the eggs to become scrambled. It should be on the creamy side. Add pepper and parmesan to taste. PASTA: Mix the flour, salt and olive oil, then beat in the eggs, (a food processor, or a mixmaster does this very easily).  When well combined, add all of the water. Work until this becomes a dough ball, and then knead for two minutes, stretching out the dough, and folding it. Put in a plastic bag, and store in the fridge for at least a half an hour. Divide the dough into four pieces, and run through the machine, adding flour (this is a good place to work in some semolina) so that the dough is not sticky. After kneading on the widest setting for about 10/15 passes, reduce the size of the roller one step at a time until you reach the thinnest size. Put through the cutter of your choice, and dry on a rack or a line. Use fresh, or freeze unused portions.  Easy, and quick and impresses the hell out of your guests!  I sometimes add thyme, or oregano to my dough when mixing (about 2 t) and this adds nicely to the taste of the dough.

I probably post this recipe at least once a month....maybe even more...but I think it is wonderful. It was originally posted by Ann Miller. Cook onion and garlic in 2 t. oil.  Add UNDRAINED tomatoes, wine, sugar and seasonings. Cover, simmer 25 min. Add shrimp, return to simmer and cook about 5 min. To tender. Blend cornstarch in 1 T. cold water, stir into shrimp mixture.  Cook to bubbly.  Serve over the hot spaghetti and sprinkle with cheese. This is also excellent made with scallops and/or chicken.

In a large pan, saute onions and garlic in oil until tender. Remove and set aside. Add chuck to pan, brown on all sides, then remove to onion dish. Add sausage and brown, Return all to pan. Add ribs, mainara sauce, water or wine, tomato paste and spices and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover partially, simmer 3 hrs. or until chuck is very tender, degreasing occasionally. Just before serving, stir in basil. Divide pasta among 6 bowls and top with meat mixture then cheese.

 This is absolutely excellent. I made my spaghetti sauce in place of marinara sauce. Next time, change the ribs and beef and substitute round steak.  The wine makes it!

Serve with a crisp salad and crusty bread.

If salted whole anchovies are used, wash them in cold running water to remove most of the external salt and any tiny scales that may be present. Use the fingers to pull the fillets from the bone. Discard the bones. Set the fillets aside.  Open the clams or have them opened and reserve both the clams and 1 cup of clam juice. Finely chop the clams and set aside.  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet. Add the garlic and shallots and cook until light brown.  Add the anchovies and stir until they dissolve.  Add the parsley, rosemary, reserved clam juice and white wine and bring to a boil.  Add pepper and a tiny bit of salt and simmer 15 minutes.  Add the chopped clams and cook 5 minutes. Serve piping hot over the freshly cooked pasta. Serve red pepper flakes on the side, if desired, but no cheese.

Cook broccoli to desired tenderness in lightly salted boiling water. RESERVE 1 CUP of BROCCOLI COOKING WATER.  Drain remaining water from broccoli and cut into bite-size chunks; set aside.

 In a medium size saucepan; heat olive oil over medium, add garlic slices and stir until lightly and evenly browned. (At this point, you can remove and dicard the garlic, but I always leave it in!) Add the butter, stirring until melted.  Add red pepper flakes and simmer 3 minutes.  Add the reserved broccoli water and simmer another minute.  Turn off heat and stir in broccoli.  Cover and set aside while cooking pasta.

 Place cooked pasta into large bowl.  Pour broccoli sauce over pasta. Toss to coat and serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper.  YUM.

While you are cooking the pasta, melt butter in a large skillet and cook, stirring, until it just turns brown. Meanwhile, toss the cheeses together (if you can't find Asiago, use Romano or Parmesan, not quite the same but still good). Drain pasta, place in a large warmed pasta bowl. Sprinkle with cheeses, drizzle with browned butter and toss well. Serve at once with parsley sprinkled over the top. Rich, but YUMMY!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2         pound  assorted trimmed mushrooms
     1/4           cup  sherry or madeira
       2    tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  whipping cream
       1    tablespoon  finely minced garlic
      12         ounce  fresh pasta or 8 ounces drie
       1    tablespoon  finely minced shallots or on
                        grated cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Here is a pasta recipe from the LA TIMES; 11/29/91 issue. The recipe is by Michael Roberts. Wipe mushrooms if necessary to remove any sand or dirt. Slice chanterelles and cultivated mushrooms, trim and discard stems of shitake mushrooms, trim and discard root tips of oyster mushrooms. Bring 4 quarts of cold, salted water to boil over high heat on stove. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat and add mushrooms, garlic, shallots and salt.  Cook, stirring, 15 minutes. Add Sherry, increase heat to high and cook 2 minutes. Add whipping cream and cook until liquid reduces to sauce-like consistency and is thick enough to coat spoon. Remove from heat and keep in warm place until pasta is finished cooking. Add pasta to boiling water, cook until desired doneness, drain and toss with mushrooms. Place on serving platter or in large serving bowl and serve immediately. Serve with grated cheese. Makes 4 servings. Now, tell me, how could this not be good? I hope anyone who makes it enjoys it in good health. Sincerererely, Punky

   1 1/4         pound  broccoli -- fresh (to 1 1/2)
       2    tablespoon  butter

     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper -- fresh ground
     3/4         pound  ziti

Cut stems off broccoli and wash thoroughly.  Chop parsley and garlic together. Steam broccoli in a little water in a covered saucepan for about 25 minutes. In another pot cook the ziti in boiling salted water for about 20 minutes.  Combine olive oil, butter, parsley, and garlic. Stir to get flavor of garlic. Warm this sauce for 2 minutes, but do not cook or burn.

 Drain broccoli and ziti as soon as cooked.  Place both in the hot pot the ziti was cooked in and pour the sauce mixture over both. Sprinkle on the cheese and black pepper, stir, and serve immediately. Have a loaf of good Italian Bread and a bottle of Barolo. Instead of dessert, try a mixed rugola and dandelion salad with Italian Salad Dressing and a soft Brie and Bel Paese cheese.

 This recipe is from "LEONE'S ITALIAN COOKBOOK."

     1/4           cup  olive oil
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1        medium  onion -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
       3        cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
       1  28 ounce can  progresso crushed tomato
     1/4           cup  freshly chopped parsley
       1  28 ounce can  progresso italian style
     1/4           cup  freshly chopped basil
       1                bay leaf

Saute onion and garlic in olive oil in medium saucepan till translucent. Put Italian style tomatoes in blender; puree, and pour into saucepan. Add can of crushed tomatoes. Add Italian seasoning, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and sugar. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Add fresh parsley and chopped basil and simmer another 15 minutes. If you would like to add browned ground beef, meatballs, or sausage....this would be the perfect sauce to do so. If you prefer a thicker sauce, add a Tbl or two of tomato paste. I personally just don't think it needs it. Rita in Scottsdale 03/24/92 21:05

The original recipe calls for ribs, but I'm afraid of the bones, so I substitute about 3/4 pound of boneless pork. Any type will do fine.

Cut dough into 4 pieces and roll as thin as you can.  Cut into rectangles 4 inches wide by 6 inches long.  Place between pieces of waxed paper. You should have about 12 pieces.  Cook, half at a time, in 4 quarts salted boiling water with olive oul added. Cook for 5 minutes. Drain and place between 2 towels. Divide stuffing into 12 parts.  Place a mound of stuffing on each dough rectangle about 1/3 inch from a long edge.  Mound should be about 1/2 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide.  Fold dough over twice.  Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking pan. Arrange manicotti about 1/4 inch apart in the pan and spoon the rest of the sauce over the top. Sprinkle a teaspoon of Parmesan cheese over each of the manicotti. Bake in a preheated slow (300 F) oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the ricotta cheese.  Combine all of the ingredients and mix well.

ingredients and mix very thoroughly. Heat 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to the boil in a large pot; add 2 tablespoons oil to help prevent pasta from sticking.  Add half of the manicotti and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until not quite al dente. Stir occasionally with a long-handled fork.  Hold a strainer over the pot and use a slotted spoon to remove 1 or 2 manicotti at a time from the boiling water, placing them in the strainer.  Shake manicotti free of water over the pot.  Spread a clean kitchen towel on the kitchen counter. Place the manicotti side by side on the towel, which will absorb all the remaining moisture.  (The shells must be completely dry before stuffing.) Repeat until all shells are cooked.  Cool.  Generously butter a baking dish, 13 x 10 inches.  Fill each shell with some of the stuffing, letting a little of the stuffing come out on either end.  This is best done with a pastry tube and a large nozzle; otherwisew use a regular teaspoon. Lay the stuffed manicotti side by side in the buttered dish and surround them with any manicotti shells you may not have sufficient stuffing for. Pour half the tomato sauce over the shells and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan ch eese. Bake in a preheated moderate oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Heat remaining tomato sauce to serve separately.  Serve with additional Parmesan Cheese.

Form into meatballs and fry *** in a large skillet with about 1/2 cup olive oil over medium high heat. Turn on all sides to brown and cook through. When all the way cooked, add them to your sauce and let them cook slowly for about 1 hour. *** Can also be browned in the oven on a baking or broiler rack. This will produce less greasy but also drier meatballs. Note: April's ancestors (on both sides) go back to Italy. I don't think the same is true for her husband!

Sprinkle chicken pieces with brown sugar and pour white wine around them. Bake for 50 min to 1 hr, basting frequently with pan juices. Chicken is done when thigh pieces, pricked with a fork at their thickest, yield clear yellow (rather than pink) juice. With a slotted spoon transfer chicken, prunes, olives and capers to a serving platter. Moisten with a few spoonfuls of pan juices and sprinkle generously with parsley or cilantro. Pass remaining pan juices in a sauce boat.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1         pound  flour
       6        ounces  sweet cream butter
       8                eggs
       3       pinches  salt -- to taste
      15        ounces  Ricotta cheese -- dry as possible
       2        ounces  spinach -- trimmed,washed
      13        ounces  Parmesan cheese -- grated
       1         Pinch  black pepper -- to taste
       2       pinches  nutmeg -- to taste
       1         quart  heavy cream
       4        ounces  Mascarpone cheese
       2       pinches  white pepper -- to taste

STEP ONE: The Dough--
Combine the following ingredients: 1 pound bleached flour, 2 ounces sweet butter, 5 eggs, and 1 pinch salt. Work the dough long enough to allow the butter to be incorporated inside the dough. Wrap the dough in a towel and let it rest, for at least one hour, inside the refrigerator.

STEP TWO: The Filling--
For the filling, steam the spinach and chop it very fine. In a bowl, beat together 2 eggs with 7 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 1 pinch each: salt, black pepper, and nutmeg. Add 15 ounces dry Ricotta cheese and mix very well, but not too long. If you mix it too much, the mixture will become liquid.

STEP THREE: The Agnolotti--
Roll out the dough in a thin layer and brush it with an egg wash (made from 1 egg). With the help of a teaspoon to make a "walnut" shape, place the spoon on the dough and cover it with another layer. Cut with a round pasta cutter 2 inches in diameter. Stuff the pasta with the filling and cook in boiling water until the agnolotti come to the surface of the boiling water.

STEP FOUR: The Sauce--
For the sauce, bring 1 quart heavy cream to a slow boil and add 4 ounces sweet butter, 6 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 4 ounces Mascarpone cheese, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of nutmeg, 2 pinches white pepper. Boil slowly for five minutes, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon.

Serve agnolotti on warm plates with warm sauce.

separate whites from yolks, and chop separately into fine dice. Recipe can
be made to this point several hours ahead.

SERVING: Arrange beans on a round serving platter in a circular fashion
with the ends meeting in the center. Whisk vinaigrette and spoon it evenly
over the beans. Crumble the Feta cheese and sprinkle it in the center of
the plate. Sprinkle chopped walnuts in a circle around the cheese.
Sprinkle chopped egg yolks in a circle around walnuts; then sprinkle
chopped egg whites in a circle around the yolks, covering all but the
outer ends of the beans. Serve at room temperature.

                     Baby Spinach Salad with Grilled Onions and Tomato Vinaigrette

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time : 0:30
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2   tablespoons  tomato paste
       1    tablespoon  tamarind pulp
     1/2    tablespoon  shallots -- chopped
     1/4           cup  sherry vinegar
   1 1/4          cups  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
       1          Dash  black pepper
       1                red onion
   1 1/2   tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
       6          cups  spinach

FOR THE DRESSING: 
Place the tomato paste, tamarind pulp, shallot, and vinegar in a blender and mix well. Slowly add the oil a drop at a time at first and then in a slow but steady stream until it is all incorporated. Add the salt. Can be kept in the refrigerator for 1 week.

FOR THE ONIONS: 
Peel and slice one large red onion thick enough so that you can handle the slices and they will not fall apart when you cook them. Rub them with a little olive oil and cook the onions over a charcoal fire or under a hot broiler until soft. (Approximately 5 to 6 minutes per side.) Toss in a bowl with 1-1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar so that the slices become single rings. These will keep refrigerated 2 to 3 days.

TO ASSEMBLE THE SALAD: 
Wash and dry one medium handful (about 1 cup) spinach for each portion and toss with enough dressing to coat each leaf, being careful not to over-dress the salad. Arrange the onions over the salad and serve. Always serve salads on chilled plates.

       1      teaspoon  Sugar
                        Chinese parsley garnish
       3     teaspoons  Thin soy sauce

Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash. Using bottom of heavy drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them not mash them so dressing can get into flesh. 

Avoid rendering a crushing blow no matter how you feel that day. Sprinkle radishes all over with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room temperature.

Prepare dressing Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce, peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice. Double amount of vinegar for a sharper taste, if desired. 

Drain liquid from radishes (salt will have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on dressing 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, transfer radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.

Fill a large (10-quart) stockpot one-third full with water. Add the lemons, potatoes, corn, onions, salt, and peppers. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.  Let boil for 10 minutes. Add the crabs, (if blue crabs are not available, substitute other small to medium crabs), cover, and return to boil.  Once steam starts to escape from under the cover, let cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes more. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking" Published by Randon House Alex says, "Serves 2 Cajuns, 4 elsewhere." He writes, "We like to lay out the crabs and vegetables on a large table covered with lots of paper and have a feast."

Combine all dry ingredients.  Add eggs, buttermilk, onions, and oil or bacon drippings.  Mix well.  Drop in deep hot fat by spoonfuls and brown on all sides. Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never counted, so I don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch. The main reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster, won't let you past that field unless you tell it something. Justin Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"

       2          cups  bacon drippings (for roux)

      20        pounds  baking hens (see directions)
                        water
       1         pound  mushrooms, sliced
      16          cups  tomato sauce
       8          cups  chablis wine

       8   tablespoons  Louisiana hot sauce
       1      teaspoon  dried mint, crushed
       6   tablespoons  salt

The bacon drippings are for browning the chicken. The 20 lbs of chicken should be cut up in 2-inch-long pieces. Justin likes more wine in this sauce than some peoples.  If you don't wish to use all 8 Cups of Chablis in the sauce, feel free to drink what the sauce don't take. Make sure you taste your sauce as you add the wine.  Me, I likes it.  My wife, she don't. Make a roux.  (see the recipe for Justin Wilson's roux, also posted here).  Add onions, bell pepper, green onions, and celery and saute until onions are tender and clear.  Add parsley and garlic and saute. Brown off chicken while roux is being made.  After onions, etc. are tender, add water to bring roux to a smooth paste.  Add all other ingredients and enough water to cover well.  Bring to a boil, and then cut heat.  Cook for about 4 to 6 hours. Serve over spaghetti.  This is for a party and will serve 20 to 40 people.  You can freeze what you don't eat. From Justin Wilson's "Outdoor Cooking With Inside Help"

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        pounds  prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)
     1/4           cup  black pepper
     1/4           cup  garlic powder
     1/4           cup  salt
       2                onions, thinly sliced
                        --seasoning mix (optional---
       1    tablespoon  plus 1 tsp, salt
       1    tablespoon  plus 2 tsp, white pepper
       1    tablespoon  plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds
       1    tablespoon  plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
   2 1/2     teaspoons  dry mustard
   2 1/2     teaspoons  ground cayenne pepper

Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save. Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through the silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous, even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt, totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place the fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours. Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool slightly.  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat cap and discard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks. TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons. Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix. using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your hands. Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least 10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place one steak in the hot  skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy, black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot. (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove, this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It causes great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet your landlord.) From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

     1/2           cup  evaporated milk

       2                eggs, lightly beaten
       1           cup  very fine bread crumbs

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

       5        pounds  small white onions
      12          ears  corn, shucked

     1/2           cup  ground black pepper
       2          cups  salt

Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones or other debris.  Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full of water.  Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil.  Add the whole onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover, lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish, cover again and raise heat to high.  After steam begins to escape from under the lid, cook 7 minutes more.  Remove from heat and let sit for 4 minutes. Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point!     Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the crawfish.  Place the crawfish in a large insulated container (an ce chest works well, as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are shipped in, which your butcher may give you for free).  Have your *SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them well to coat.  Cover and let sit for 7 minutes.     Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new potatoes, and lots of French bread on a large table covered with plenty of paper.  When everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels for the house."  The peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day. Serves 8-10

NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until after the cooking process because too much salt added during cooking makes the flesh of the crawfish adhere to the shell.

Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible. Also, use this marinade as a basting sauce. Some people may find Justin's 3 cups of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste. No problem, use as much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest. Sure won't go to waste.

       4        pounds  boneless sirloin roast

In a small bowl combine the onions, celery, bell peppers, butter and seasonings, mix well. Place roast in a large roasting pan, fat side up. With a large knife make 6 to 12 deep slits in the meat (to form pockets) down to a depth of about 1/2 inch from the bottom; do not cut all the way through.  Fill the pockets to their depths with the vegetable mixture, reserving about 1 tablespoon of the vegetables to rub over the top of the roast. Bake uncovered at 300F until a meat thermometer reads about 160F for medium doneness, about 3 hours. For rarer roast, cook until thermometer reads 140F. Serve immediately topped with some of the pan drippings if you like. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

      10          lge.  tomatoes -- peeled & seeded
       2     teaspoons  salt
       1      teaspoon  ground red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground white pepper
       1    tablespoon  fresh thyme
       1    tablespoon  fresh basil

       1           cup  green onions -- chopped
       1           cup  parsley -- chopped

Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and peels in a small saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a slow boil over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes.  Strain and discard the heads and peels.    Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator (I find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in the refrigerator).    When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes.  Stir in the green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on flat plates over beds of rice. Serves 6-8. SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA: Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham and a 4-ounce can of tomatoes sauce to the finished sauce and simmer 45 minutes more. Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice. Finish the sauce (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding the shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above.  (If you are using leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp and reheat the sauce, add the ham and tomato sauce, and proceed as above.  Return the shrimp to the pan at the end of cooking.)  Place the hot, cooked rice in a large bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well, and serve.    You can also prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham.

       2          cups  chopped unpeeled apples

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter as possible).  Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like rice Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice.  Lucy used brown, long grain rice - super!.  This will require about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.  (We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)   Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       6          8 oz  redfish fillets -- (8 to 10)
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter, melted
                        -------seasoning mix--------
       1    tablespoon  sweet paprika
   2 1/2     teaspoons  salt
       1      teaspoon  onion powder
       1      teaspoon  garlic powder
       1      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  ground white pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano leaves

NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this method of cooking.  If tilefish is used, you may have to split the fillets in half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If you can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper fillets can be substituted. In any case, the fillets or steaks must not be more than 3/4 inch thick. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet bottom (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least 10 minutes. (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)    Meanwhile, pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter in its skillet.  Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl. Dip each fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both sides are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix generously and evenly on both sides of the fillets, patting by hand. Place in the hot skillet and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet (be careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook, uncovered, over the same high heat until the underside looks charred, about 2 minutes (the time will vary according to the fillet's thickness and the heat of the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour 1 teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve each fillet while piping hot.    To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each heated serving plate. I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It is a taste experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should you ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't go to K Paul's and order this.  Even people who don't like fish love this dish. From Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, published by William Morrow and Company, Inc.  ISBN 0-688-02847-0

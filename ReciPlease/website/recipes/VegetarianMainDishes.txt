retain their shape. Drain well and set aside.

In a large no-stick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions
and sauti for 4 minutes, or until tender. Add the garlic, peas, corn and
carrots. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from
the heat. Stir in the rice, shredded mozzarella and basil.

Preheat the oven to 375:.

Stuff the peppers with the rice mixture; top each with a slice of
mozzarella. Place the peppers upright in an 8" W 8" no-stick baking dish.
Pour 1/4" water into the dish. Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated
through. Turn on the broiler and broil about 6" from the heat for 3
minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned and bubbly. Serve with the
tomato sauce.

                        REQUIRED INGREDIENTS
       2        pounds  cauliflower -- cut into bite-size-pieces
     1/4           cup  yogurt (thick)
       1           cup  chick pea flour
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  carom seed (ajwain in Hindi/vaamu in Telug
     1/4      teaspoon  red chili powder

In a bowl mix all the ingredients except cauliflower pieces. The batter must have the same consistency as that of a cake.

Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter such that they are completely covered with the batter.

In a deep skillet heat oil on medium and when oil is hot add the batter-covered cauliflower pieces. Fry until this batch is about half done (just about when the color of the batter starts to change) and remove from heat and keep aside.

Do the same for all the batches. In the end take the first batch and refry them until they turn brown. Repeat for the other batches. 

Goes well with ketchup.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         clove  garlic -- minced
       2   tablespoons  olive oil -- extra-virgin
       2         pound  asparagus -- trimmed and cut into
       2     teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper -- freshly ground
       4           cup  vegetable broth 
       4                eggs
     1/2           cup  parmesan* -- *fresly grated, PLUS
       6         slice  Italian bread -- toasted

In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  

Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle. Remove from the heat.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.  

Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or slightly stale bread.

     1/2           cup  Olive oil

Wash artichokes; remove outer leaves until pale yellow leaves are exposed. Cut off top two inches and stems so artichokes will sit upright. Remove fuzzy centers and rub all surfaces with half of lemon. Add juice of remaining lemon to water and dip artichokes to preserve green color.

Mix mint and garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil and spoon into hollows of artichokes. Place in pan just large enough to hold them upright. Add water to depth of three inches, remaining olive oil and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 25 minutes or until just tender.

Cooking will vary with size of artichokes. Remove artichokes, drain and hold warm. Reduce cooking liquid until of a syrupy consistency. Spoon sauce over artichokes and serve.

  second sheet over the first and brush with oil

 Fold the phyllo into thirds vertically, making a strip
  about 4" wide.


 Place 2/3 cup of spinach filling on bottom left corn
  of phyllo. Encase it by folding the left-hand, bottom
  corner over the filling, forming a triangle with two
  equal sides.


Continue folding at a right angle to the end of the
  strip.


Repeat with remaining phyllo sheets until all filling
  is used.


  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown.


Serve immediately or store up to one week in

NOTES : The above recipe is based on an Indonesian dish traditionally made with peanuts. We are using almonds here. Peanuts are not recommended. A fungus called aflatoxin naturally occurs in the peanut crop. Although the crops are inspected for it, a certain percentage is allowed and since it is a proven carcinogen, peanuts are best left alone. Another reason peanut butter isnt recommended is that it is not possible to make a butter out of raw peanuts. Peanut butter is produced from roasted peanuts.

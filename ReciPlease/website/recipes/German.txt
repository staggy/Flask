Cut the cabbage into quarters, remove the stem and tough outer leaves, and grate coarsely.  Add the grated cabbage to 4 quarts of boiling salted water and bring to a boil.  After 2 to 3 minutes, put in a colander to drain; shake it dry; press out the (66 min left), (H)elp, More? remaining liquid. While the cabbage is still lukewarm, put it into a salad bowl, sprinkle with vinegar, and mix well.  Allow this to sit for several minutes. Shortly before serving, cook the diced bacon until the fat has been rendered and pour the entire contents of the skillet (fat and bacon) over the salad.  Season to taste with salt, white pepper, and a little sugar. Makes 4 cups. (Note: If using red cabbage, add a Tbsp vinegar to the boiling water before adding the shredded cabbage.  This will set the color of the cabbage.  With red cabbage, many people prefer to substitute 1/3 cup salad oil for the bacon, which should be sprinkled cold over the still lukewarm (66 min left), (H)elp, More?         cabbage.)

Beat for an additional 2 minutes. Add enough flour to form a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place dough in a greased bowl.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down and let rise again until doubled. (1 hour more).  Divide dough in half.  Shape pretzel as follows:  Roll dough into a rope about 30 inches long and 1 1/2 inches in diameter.  Cross the ends leaving a large loop in the center.  Flip loop back onto crossed ends to form a pretzel.  Repeat with remaining dough. Place pretzels on greased baking sheets.  Let rise 15 minutes more.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.  Mix confectioners' sugar, water and vanilla to form a thin icing. Spread icing on pretzels and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Makes 2 large pretzels.

Nothing expresses the German love of edible art more succinctly than marzipan candies, which are shaped into piglets, cats, poodles, flowers, fruit and all sorts of other objects. They are delicious to eat, too. Carefully dry the shelled almonds, then grind to a powder in an electric blender, if you have one. Blend almonds, the sugar, the egg white and just enough rosewater or orangewater (available from pharmacies) to make a pliable stiff dough. Knead with fingers, then place on board dusted with confectioners' sugar and form into desired shapes, to resemble miniature apples, peaches, strawberries or, if you have an artist's touch, little pigs or birds. Tint with (65 min left), (H)elp, More? food coloring. Balls of marzipan may be rubbed in chocolate dots or colored sugar. If dough becomes too stiff, work in a little lemon juice, rosewater or orangewater, adding drop by drop. When candies are shaped, dry thoroughly in a cool, airy place for 24 hours, then wrap separately or place in a container (such as a little straw basket for fruit) and cover completely with Saran or other plastic wrap. Makes 2 pounds of candy.

                        e  *****

Get some pork- or veal-Schnitzels. Wash the meat; dry with a paper towel and rub with pepper, salt and just a little brown sugar. Cook in (real) butter in an open pan on both sides until the meat is done and takes on a nice brown. Set aside and keep hot. In the meat juice left in the pan, cook _fresh_ mushrooms (about a pound for 2 Schnitzels; any kind of mushrooms will work, but the white mushrooms you get in any super market or, if you collect your own, a mix of wild forest mushrooms, seem to be best) until the liquid is mostly gone, adding pepper, salt and More(Y/n/=)? sugar (be careful with the sugar; too much of it will spoil the mushrooms) to taste. Stir in fresh cream (unwhipped) until you get a thick sauce. Pour on top of the Schnitzels, serve with french fries or croquettes. Variations: You might try to add a little cooking sherry, onions and/or garlic to the mushroom gravy (the onions and the garlic are cooked together with the mushrooms; the sherry is added with the cream).

     1/2      teaspoon  sugar

In a medium bowl cover brown rice with hot water and soak for 3 hours. Drain.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine rice, 3 cups water, and 1 1/2 t salt.  Simmer covered for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.  Add the dillseed, marjoram, and 1/2 t pepper.  In a large skillet saute 1 1/2 cups chopped onion in 3 T hot vegetable oil until soft, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Add paprika and garlic, continue cooking and stirring for 2 minutes.  Stir in the rice mixture, eggs, bread crumbs, and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Core cabbage and, in a large pot, blanch the cabbage cored-side-down in boiling salted water for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Drain.  Remove 12 leaves and cut off one fourth of each leaf from the base.  Arrange 1 leaf curved-side down on a square of dampened cheesecloth and place 3 T of rice mixture in the center.  Wrap the leaf around the filling and twist the corners of the cheesecloth to form the leaf into a roll.  Continue making rolls with remaining filling.  Chop remaining cabbage to make 3 cups and, in a large frypan, saute with 1 cup chopped onions and 2 T vegetable oil until soft.  Add tomatoes, vermouth, broth, tomato paste, sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper.  Simmer the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Adjust seasonings. Transfer cabbage-tomato sauce mixture to a large baking dish.  Arrange the cabbage rolls close together in one layer on the sauce.  Spoon some of the mixture over the rolls.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours.  Baste rolls 4 to 5 times during cooking.  Let the dish cool.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Remove cheesecloth.  Heat in preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before serving.

       3       bottles  red wine
       1         small  sugar hat
       1         piece  orange peel
       1        bottle  golden rum
       1         piece  lemon peel
                        at least 108 proof
       5                cloves

Put orange peel, lemon peel and cloves into a tea filter bag, tie shut with white yarn. Hang into a copper kettle, pour in wine. Heat up close to boiling point, but make sure it never gets to boil. Put the kettle in the middle of your table so all your guests can watch the ceremony :-). You normally use a "Feuerzange", but as I suspect this might be hard to get (58 min left), (H)elp, More?   outside Europe I guess you can also use a grid from your barbecue set - especially the ones you normally use to barbecue herrings in should work pretty well. The point is that you should be able to put the sugar hat on it (lying on its side) and place the whole thing safely over the kettle. Once you've got that far, you're ready for the ceremony. First, dim your lights. Then pour some rum onto the sugar hat, best using a ladle, and light it (this is why the rum has to be at least 108 proof). Keep the flames burning by ladling more rum on the sugar hat, until the sugar has completely melted and dripped into the wine. Remove the "Feuerzange" and the bag with the spices. Serve in heat-proof glasses.

 Variation: Many people like to add sugar and/or a little orange juice (preferably freshly pressed).

       1      teaspoon  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  sour cream

Thoroughly mix ground meats, onion, bread crumbs, 3 T cold water, and eggs.  Flavor with salt, praprika, mustard, and parsley.  Blend ingredients thoroughly.  Flatten out meat mixture in the shape of a square, (8 X 8-inches).  Arrange whole hard-boiled eggs in a row along the middle of the meat.  Fold sides of meat pattie over the eggs.  Shape meat carefully into a loaf resembling a flat bread loaf.  Occasionally rinse hands in cold water to prevent sticking.  Cube 2 strips bacon; cook in a Dutch oven about 2 minutes.  Carefully add the vegetable oil; heat.  Place meatloaf in the Dutch oven and cook until browned on all sides.  Cut remaining bacon strips in half and arrange over the top of the meatloaf. Place uncovered Dutch oven in a preheated oven for about 45 minutes. While meat is baking, gradually pour hot beef broth over the top of the meatloaf; brush occasionally with pan drippings.  When done remove meat to a preheated platter and keep it warm.  Add 1/4 cup of hot water to pan and scrape all particles from the bottom.  Bring to a gentle boil and add cornstarch that has been mixed with 1/4 cup water.  Cook until bubbly and thick.  Remove from heat and stir in sour cream.  Reheat to warm.  Season with salt and pepper if desired.  Serve the sauce separately.

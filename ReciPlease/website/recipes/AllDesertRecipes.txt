      24                decorative leaves -- non-poisonous lemon
                        florists leaves

For the Mousse: In the top of a double boiler, set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolates with the coffee and the Kahlua, stirring occasionally. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 3 tb. of the sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and stir in the chocolate mixture. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they are frothy, add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft peaks. Beat in the remaining 1 tb. sugar gradually and beat the whites until they just hold stiff peaks. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the remaining whites and the whipped cream, gently but thoroughly. Pour the mousse into a 1 qt. shallow dish and chill, covered, for at least two hours. (This may be made a day in advance) Before serving, arrange some of the chocolate leaves on the mousse, and serve the remaining leaves separately. Chocolate leaves: In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate. with a spoon, coat the back (non-shiny) side of each leaf with the chocolate, being careful not to let the chocolate drip onto the shiny side. Place the leaves, chocolate side up on a jelly roll pan lined with wax paper, and prop the edges of the leaves with pieces of foil or paper towel to allow the edges to curl.  Chill the leaves for 20 minutes, or until the chocolate has hardened, and, working quickly, peel off the lemon leaves. (If the chocolate gets too soft, chill the leaves for 5 minutes more, or until hardened). Keep the leaves chilled until just before serving. Makes 24 leaves.

Add egg yolks, and beat very well. Beat egg whites separately and fold chocolate mixture into whites. Pour into sherbet glasses and chill. Serves 4-6.

Stew the fruit, sweeten to taste and pour into a 9x9 cake pan. I frequently do this in the microwave. Sift dry cake ingredients together.  Mix the egg, milk and butter and stir gently into the flour mixture. Pour the cake mixture over the rhubarb and cook at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown. For a real cholesterol disaster, pour heavy cream over this while warm for serving.  It tastes great without it but I like the cream for company. The cake can be baked by itself in an 8x8 pan. Bake about 20 - 25 minutes. It makes a wonderful shortcake for fruit. The cookbook (Fanny Farmer) calls it Cottage Pudding.

       2        ounces  rum

Whip heavy cream until stiff. Whip egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until pale yellow. Add mascarpone and whip until mixed well. Whip in the stiffly beaten heavy cream until all is mixed well. Use almost any size container, usually a 9 x 13 clear dish. Put half of the cheese mixture on the bottom, spreading evenly. Mix the coffee with the kahlua, rum and 2 tbls sugar. Soak the lady fingers, with the coffee mix, one at a time, until they absorb some of the liquid, but still feel a little crisp. Place the soaked lady fingers over the cheese layer in the dish. Top with the rest of the cheese mixture and smooth over all with the back of a spoon. Coarsely chop some bittersweet chocolate and sprinkle it over the top. Let stand chilled at least 6 hours before serving.

       1                sponge cake -- 3 inch tall

                        cocoa powder

Cut the cake across the middle to form 2 halves. Blend the coffee and kahlua together. Sprinkle the one half of the cake with the coffee and kahlua mix, enough to strongly flavor the cake, but do not saturate the cake so much that it collapses. Mix the cream cheese and sugar, beating until light and spreadable. Spread over this half of the cake in a fairly thick layer. Set the other half on top of this. Repeat the process. Put the cocoa powder in a wire strainer and coat the top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa. Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving. May use favorite liqueur or rum or brandy instead of kahlua.

Soak cherries in rum. Sift sugar; cocoa, and instant coffee together and place in a heavy sauce pan. Add the water and mix well. Bring to a boil and cook until everything is well mixed. While syrup is cooking, whip the egg yolks until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed of the beaters to the lowest level and add the hot syrup in a continuous fine stream. Continue beating until the mixture is thick and forms a ribbon pattern when the beater is pulled away. Chill well. Whip the cream with the 2 tablespoons of rum until stiff. Fold into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the chopped chocolate. Arrange foil lined paper cups in a muffin pan. Fill each cup 1/3 of the way full. Place a cherry in each cup then fill the rest of the way. Freeze at least 4 hrs. Before serving pipe whipping cream on top if desired. It will keep in the freezer for about a month.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       3          cups  heavy cream
       1           Cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
       2                Vanilla beans -- split lengthwise,
                        -- or
       2   tablespoons  vanilla extract
       4         large  egg yolks

NOTE:  To make a lighter ice cream, use 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of cream.  To make a richer ice cream, add 2 more egg yolks.

 In a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, milk, sugar and vanilla beans.  (If you're using vanilla extract, do not add it until later on in the recipe.)  Stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved and mixture is hot but not boiling.

 Whisk yolks together in bowl.  Continue whisking and very slowly pour in about 1 cup of the cream mixture.  When smooth, pour back into to the saucepan.

 Whisk constantly over low heat until mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a spoon (about 5 minutes).  Take care that mixture doesn't boil, or it will curdle.  Draw your finger across the back of the coated spoon.  If the line you make remains, custard is done.

 Remove vanilla beans; or is you're using vanilla extract, add it now.

 Freeze in ice cream churn according to manufacturer's instructions.

In a small saucepan melt sugar over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. 
Heat oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will fall as a liquid sauce over the custard.

       2   Tablespoons  Agar -- flakes
   2 1/2          Cups  Water
     3/4           Cup  Cashew Butter
     1/4           Cup  Honey
       1      Teaspoon  Vanilla
       1    Tablespoon  Lemon Juice

Put the agar and water in a saucepan and heat until agar granules are dissolved. Agar flakes may require simmering several minutes before they are ready; follow the directions on the jar. When agar water is ready, remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. Put agar water and remaining ingredients into a blender and whip for one minute. Pour the mixture into an ice cream freezer. Following the freezer instructions, freeze until firm. Store ice cream in the refrigerator freezer until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Omit one cup of water and add one cup of fruit pulp just before pouring into the freezer. Bananas, strawberries, or peaches make excellent fruit-flavored ice creams. For carob ice cream, add 1/4 cup carob flour. Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for a delicious flavor and a crunchy texture. Substitute any kind of nut or seed butter for cashew butter.

     1/2           cup  Butter -- softened
       3         large  Eggs

CAKE:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. 

In a small saucepan, combine mint-chocolate chips and 1/4 cup of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Cool 10 minutes. 

In medium bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; set aside. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar and butter; beat until creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend in chocolate mixture. Gradually beat in flour mixture alternately with remaining 1 cup of water. Pour into 2 greased and floured 9-inch round baking pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cakes test done. Cool completely on wire racks. Fill and frost with Chocolate Mint Frosting. Garnish as desired.

CHOCOLATE-MINT FROSTING:
Combine over hot (not boiling) water, the mint-chocolate chips and butter. Stir until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Stir in vanilla extract and salt. Transfer to a large bowl. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar alternately with milk; beat until smooth. (if necessary add more milk until desired consistency is reached.)

GARNISHES:
Use chocolate curls and grated chocolate on top of the cake. Form a ring of grated chocolate pieces around the outside edge and use the curls in the center. To make chocolate leaves, select several small leaves, wash and dry them and paint one side of them with melted chocolate. Chill until firm and peel the leaf off the chilled chocolate. Use as garnish.

Keep popcorn warm in a 300-degree Fahrenheit oven. In a heavy medium saucepan, combine sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves; clip candy thermometer to pan.
Cook syrup to 250 degrees (hard-ball stage); remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour syrup in thin stream over popcorn, tossing to coat kernels evenly.
Butter or dampen hands: quickly shape glazed popcorn into 7 or 8 egg-shaped forms for bunny bodies, about 6 inches long each. With a rolling pin, roll 15 to 16 gumdrops on a sugared board until flat. Cut 7 or 8 pairs of rabbit ears from gumdrops; insert wooden picks at one end and stick 1 pair into head end of each popcorn bunny.
Use Lifesavers or licorice drops for eyes, gumdrop "trimmings" for noses and mouths, and several short pieces of licorice strings for whiskers; attach to bunny faces with a little hot corn syrup. For tails, secure remaining gum drops to bunnies with wooden picks.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  Active Dry Yeast
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  Bulk Active Dry Yeast
     1/4           cup  Warm Water -- (110-115 Deg F)
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/3           cup  Butter OR Regular Margarine
       1    tablespoon  Orange Juice
       2     teaspoons  Rum Extract
       1           cup  Milk -- scalded
                        Unbleached Flour -- up to 4 cups
       2         large  Eggs -- well beaten
                        Fat For Deep Frying -- heated to 375
                        degrees F
                        Jam OR Jelly

Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. 
Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl. Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes).
About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.
Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut. Force about 1/2 teaspoon of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

       1       package  yeast -- dry
       1      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4           cup  water -- warm (110)
     3/4           cup  milk -- room temp
       2    tablespoon  sugar
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted
       1      teaspoon  salt
   3 1/2           cup  flour (a/p or bread)
                        filling:
       8         ounce  muenster cheese
       8         ounce  jarlsberg or swiss
       8         ounce  cheddar -- white
       2                eggs -- beat slightly
       2    tablespoon  parsley -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper -- white

Dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in 1/4 cup water and let stand 5-10 minutes to proof until foamy. Add milk, 2 tbs sugar, butter, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Place in greased bowl and turn to coat all sides. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. Shred cheeses, combine all filling ingredients and refrigerate. Grease a 9"  springform pan very well. Punch down dough, shape into a ball, and roll to a 20" circle. Ease dough into pan (fold in half to lift and unfold in pan) letting excess hang over the edge. Mound cheese filling onto dough in pan and bring dough up over the filling, folding to make 8-12 evenly spaced pleats. Twist and pinch ends together to make a rough knob. Cover with a buttered 12" square of waxed paper and let rise until double in bulk. Brush loaf with glaze of 1 egg white + 1 tbs water (or use marg). Bake 40-50 min. @ 375 Or until deep golden brown. Remove bread from pan, place directly on oven rack, and bake for an additional 5 minutes to brown bottom crust. Cool on rack for 45 minutes before cutting into wedges. * Served with soup or salad, this is a full meal!!! Can substitute 4 oz muenster and 4 oz swiss for 8 oz cheddar.

       1           cup  milk -- scalded
     1/2           cup  shortening
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1                yeast cake -- or 1 pkg dry
       3                eggs -- beaten
   4 1/2          cups  flour

Combine hot milk, shortening, sugar, and salt.  Mix but don't worry if shortening doesn't all melt.  Cool to lukewarm.  Add yeast and mix.  Add eggs and mix.  Add flour and mix well to make a smooth soft dough.  (This is not the kind of dough you have to knead - it will be very soft and sticky.)  Let rise to double in volume. Punch the dough down and refrigerate until cold.

Turn chilled dough out onto floured pastry cloth and knead briefly. Divide dough into thirds.  Roll out one third at a time.  Roll into a large circle about 1/8 inch thick.  Brush surface of dough with melted butter.  Cut circle of dough into 8 pie shaped wedges.  Roll up each wedge starting at the wide end.  Place each roll on baking sheet and curve it into a crescent shape.  (Be sure to put the pointy end on the bottom otherwise roll may start to unroll as it rises or bakes.)  Brush tops of rolls with melted butter.  Cover with a cloth and let rise until almost double.  Bake at 350 F for 16 minutes.

Note:  These are fairly large rolls.  If you prefer smaller rolls divide dough into quarters instead of thirds.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2      packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water
       2          cups  lukewarm milk -- (scaled then
                        -- cooled)
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil or shortening
       3     teaspoons  baking powder
       2     teaspoons  salt
       1                Egg
       5          cups  all-purpose flour -- up to 6
       4   tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  + 1 Tsp. cinnamon
                        Powder Sugar Frosting

 Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Stir in milk, 1/3 cup sugar, the oil, baking powder, salt, egg and 2 to 3 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.  Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.

 Turn dough onto well floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up.  Cover, let rise in warm place until double, about 1 1/2 hours.  (dough is ready if an indention remains when touched.)

 Grease 2 oblong pans, 13x9x2 inches.  Punch down dough; divide into halves.  Roll 1 half into rectangle, 12x10 inches.  Spread with half of the butter.  Mix 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon; sprinkle half the sugar-cinnamon mixture over rectangle.  Roll up, beginning at wide side.  Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal.  Stretch roll to make even.

 Cut roll into 12 slices.  Place slightly apart in 1 pan.  Wrap pan tightly with heavy aluminum foil.  Repeat with remaining dough.  Refrigerate at least 12 hours but no longer than 48 hours.  (To bake immediately, do not wrap. Let rise in warm place until double, about 30 minutes.  Bake as directed below.)

 Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove foil from pans.  Bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes.  Frost with Powdered Sugar Frosting while warm.

Makes 24 rolls.

POWDERED SUGAR FROSTING:  Mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp. milk and 1/2 Tsp. vanilla until smooth and of spreading consistency.  Frost 1 pan of rolls.

VARIETIES OF ICEBOX ROLLS:

CARAMEL PECAN ICEBOX ROLLS:  Omit Powdered Sugar Frosting.  Before rolling dough into rectangles, heat 1 cup brown sugar (packed) and 1/2 cup butter until melted; remove from heat.  Stir in 2 Tbsp. light corn syrup.   Divide caramel mixture between pans.  Sprinkle each with 1/2 cup pecan halves.  Roll dough, slice, refrigerate and bake as directed.  Immediately invert pan on large tray.  Let pan remain over rolls 1 minute so caramel drizzles over rolls.

ORANGE MARMALADE ICEBOX ROLLS:  Omit butter, sugar-cinnamon mixture and Powdered Sugar Frosting.  Before rolling dough into rectangles, beat 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup orange marmalade and 1/4 cup butter, softened, until smooth and creamy.  Spread each rectangle with 1/3 cup of the marmalade mixture.  Roll dough, slice, refrigerate and bake as directed.  Frost with remaining marmalade mixture while warm.

                     Cranberry-Orange Anadama Rolls

Recipe By     : The New Carry-Out Cuisine by Phyllis Meras

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  cranberry juice
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
       4   tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temp
     1/3           cup  dark molasses
       2   tablespoons  dark molasses
       1             t  salt
       1       package  dry yeast
     1/2             c  warm water
       1             c  whole-wheat flour
   2 1/2             c  cranberries -- fresh, whole
                        zest of 1 orange, grated
       4             c  all-purpose flour -- up to 5 cups
       1                egg -- lightly beat w/ 1 T
                        additional cornmeal for tops of rolls

In a small saucepan, heat cranberry juice to a simmer and gradually stir in the cornmeal [whisk constantly to avoid lumps]. Reduce heat to low and stir the mixture continuously with a wooden spoon [whisk] until the mixture is thick and smooth like porridge, 5 to 7 minutes [this took more like 10 minutes, and there were still lumps, but they were incorporated when the dough was mixed together later]. Add 1/3 c of molasses [I used 1/4c] and the salt and set aside to cool to lukewarm.

Meanwhile, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a large mixing bowl for 10 minutes. Stir in the whole wheat flour and the cooled cornmeal  mixture.

Place cranberries, orange zest and remaining molasses [I left out this molasses] in a food processor and pulse several times until berries are coarsely chopped (or chop by hand). Add to dough mixture and stir thoroughly. Add the all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. [I added more than 5 cups and it was still sticky--keep in mind it will stay sticky, and just add enough to make it manageable.] Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turn to grease the top, and cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours [I put it in the refrigerator at this point and finished them the next morning].

Punch down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Tear off pieces of the dough and shape into smooth balls, about 2" in diam. Place 2" apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in bulk, 30-45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375F. Brush all over with the egg wash and sprinkle tops lightly with cornmeal. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown.

Note:  The book says this yields 18 rolls. I made dough balls the size of golf balls and ended up with about 30 rolls the size of small dinner rolls.

In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand for about 5 minutes to soften.  Stir in milk, butter, egg, salt, sugar, and cardamom until blended. With spoon, stir in 7 cups of the flour or enough to form a stiff dough.  Knead about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking.  Place dough in greased bowl, grease top, cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled (1-1/2 to 2 hours). Punch dough down and knead briefly on floured board to release air. Divide into 6 equal portions; pull each into a rope about 24 inches long. Place 3 ropes on a greased baking sheet, pinch tops together, and braid loosely.  Form braid into a ring, pinching ends together.  Repeat to make a second braided wreath.  Cover and let rise until almost doubled (about 40 minutes). Bake in a 350  oven until loaves are medium brown (35 to 40 minutes). Transfer loaves to a rack and let cool for 10 minutes, then serve warm. Or, if made ahead, let cool completely, then wrap airtight and freeze. Thaw unwrapped.  To reheat, wrap in foil and heat in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes. To serve, spoon half the Lemon Icing around top of each wreath, letting it drizzle down sides.  Decorate with cherries, if desired.

     1/4           cup  water -- at 105 deg. f
     1/3           cup  turbinado sugar -- or reg sugar
       2     envelopes  dry yeast
     1/4           cup  butter
     1/4           cup  shortening
   5 1/2          cups  water
     1/2           cup  milk
       1         large  egg
       1           cup  nonfat dry milk
   5 1/2     teaspoons  salt
   1 1/2   tablespoons  honey
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  rolled oats
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
     1/4           cup  bran
     1/4           cup  cracked wheat
     1/4           cup  buckwheat
     1/2           cup  soy flour
       1           cup  rye flour
   2 1/2          cups  whole-wheat flour
       3          cups  white flour
                        butter

Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not to kill the yeast when they are added to the dough.  If you want to scald the milk, do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to scald milk before baking with it, though I never do.)

Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.

Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat, soy flour, and rye flour.  Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter, shortening, egg, and honey, and mix well.  Stir in the dissolved yeast mixture.  Mix in the salt, and the whole wheat flour.

Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture is stiff enough to knead.  You'll probably have about half of it left.

Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface.  Knead the dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten minutes.  It's okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white flour; just use whatever it takes.

Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased.  Let it rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 deg. F is best, though room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it has doubled in bulk.

Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves, and place each half into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased.  Let rise again, for another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the loaves have about doubled in bulk.

Preheat the oven to 350 deg. F as the bread finishes rising.  Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped.  Remove from the loaf pans, and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them a nice, soft, chewy crust.

                     Pizza Dough

Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      envelope  dry yeast
     1/4      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  lukewarm water -- 75-80 degrees f
   1 3/4          cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- or bread flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Stir yeast and sugar into water, let sit for 8 minutes or so. It should become slightly foamy with a familiar "yeast" odor. No foam after 6 or so minutes and the yeast was bad or your water wrong temperature.  I haven't had a yeast problem yet.

In a bowl (or food processor) mix 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour or bread flour 1/2 teaspoon salt

Add the yeast mixture.  If using food processor, continue running until dough forms a ball, 10-20 seconds.  By hand, just jump in and mix away.  If you've never done dough before, it gets a little sticky.

If the dough is a little dry (ie: flour left on sides of bowl and you absolutely can't get it mixed) add 1/2 teaspoon water and try until you get it.  If measured right, you shouldn't need any additional water.

On a floured surface pick up dough and throw it down HARD 8-10 times (really, you can't hurt it, think of your boss...)  Continue kneading for 2 minutes or so. if dough is a little sticky, dust your finger and counter with flour, but as little as possible).

That it.  Either rolls out by hand for an 11" pizza (14" thin or 7" thick). Bake at 500F in pre-heated oven for 8-12 minutes, the edges will turn nice golden brown when done.  Dough will be firm and crispy, not soggy and soft like many other doughs.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2          cups  milk -- very warm
     2/3           cup  sugar -- or honey
     2/3           cup  vegetable oil -- not olive
       4     teaspoons  salt
     3/4         ounce  dry yeast
   1 1/2          cups  whole-grain flour -- graham
   1 1/2          cups  bread flour
                        remainder all purpose white flour

Mix all the non-flour items (make sure the milk is not too hot to the touch, or it will kill the yeast).  Mix in the whole wheat and bread flour.  Then knead in enough of the all purpose flour so  that the dough does not stick appreciably to your hands (this may take 10 minutes of kneading).  Put the dough into a really large bowl, rub some oil on the top of the dough so it doesn't get crusty (dry out) when rising. Cover the bowl with some waxed paper (etc.) and put in a warm place. When approx. doubled in size, form portions of dough into loaves and put in pans (This makes about 6 small loaves for me). Put pans with dough in them in a warm place (I just put them in the oven at this point and don't turn the gas on until its risen).  Let them rise until about doubled.  Bake at 325F for small loaves, 300F for big loaves (my oven's a bit hot, so you may need a slightly higher temperature) on the bottom rack in the oven until the tops are all brown.  After taking the pans out of the oven, let cool for about 5 minutes then take the bread out of the pans  and lay them on their sides on cooling racks.  When they're cool, I put most of them in zip-lock bags and freeze them for the week.

  Dissolve yeast in warm water. Beat 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl; add salt, sugar, dissolved yeast, and butter. To this mixture, add 4 cups of the flour (all at once). Stir in the flour and continue to add 3 more cups of flour until the dough is of a soft consistency.   Knead the dough on a floured board until the dough is no longer sticky and is springy to the touch.   Place the dough in a greased mixing bowl and cover with a towel. Let rise 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.   Punch down the dough, knead it a little, and divide it in 6 pieces.   Roll each piece with your hands so they become long, skinny ropes. Braid 3 ropes, pinching the ends together. Repeat the process with the other 3 ropes.   Place each braided loaf on it`s own greased cookie sheet, cover with a towel, and let rise about an hour- until doubled in bulk. Brush the loaves with the 2 beaten eggs, sprinkle with poppy seeds or sesame seeds (optional).   DO NOT PRE-HEAT OVEN- Bake in a 350F degree oven about 45 minutes, until the bread is golden-brown.

       6          cups  rye flour -- approximate
       3          cups  white flour -- approximate
     1/2           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
       2     teaspoons  anise seed -- crushed
       1      teaspoon  salt

Scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a very large bowl.  (You need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts.) When the mixture is lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, then stir in 2 cups rye flour and 1 cup white flour to make a paste.

Let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy. This usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour.  Check it frequently-it can really make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl.  (I'm sure they could make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that keeps getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path....)

Stir in the granulated sugar, oil, molasses, anise seed and salt, and enough flour to make a stiff dough, using 2 parts rye to 1 part white. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, adding more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands.

Clean and grease the bowl.  Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to grease all sides.  Cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough rise until it's doubled in bulk.  Punch it down and let rise until double again.

Divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans.  (I usually make round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets.)  Cover with the towel and let rise until double again.

Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 deg. F.  Because of the high sugar content, this bread can burn rather easily; watch it closely so it doesn't get too dark.

  Dissolve yeast in warm water. Beat 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl; add salt, sugar, dissolved yeast, and butter. To this mixture, add 4 cups of the flour (all at once). Stir in the flour and continue to add 3 more cups of flour until the dough is of a soft consistency.   Knead the dough on a floured board until the dough is no longer sticky and is springy to the touch.   Place the dough in a greased mixing bowl and cover with a towel. Let rise 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.   Punch down the dough, knead it a little, and divide it in 6 pieces.   Roll each piece with your hands so they become long, skinny ropes. Braid 3 ropes, pinching the ends together. Repeat the process with the other 3 ropes.   Place each braided loaf on it`s own greased cookie sheet, cover with a towel, and let rise about an hour- until doubled in bulk. Brush the loaves with the 2 beaten eggs, sprinkle with poppy seeds or sesame seeds (optional).   DO NOT PRE-HEAT OVEN- Bake in a 350F degree oven about 45 minutes, until the bread is golden-brown.

Punch dough down; turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in dates and almonds. Divide dough in half; shape into 2 balls. Place in 2 greased 8-inch round cake pans. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Bake at 350:F for 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks. Top with confectioners' sugar frosting, if desired.

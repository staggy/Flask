--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/3           cup  water
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
     2/3      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  oregano
       4           cup  bread flour
   2 1/2      teaspoon  yeast
                        -----spinach filling-----
  10 1/2         ounce  frozen chopped spinach
                        garlic powder
       2    tablespoon  olive oil
       1           cup  provolone cheese -- grated +-
       1           cup  mozzarella cheese -- grated +-

Remove dough from machine and roll it into circles of approximately 8 inches. Spread filling on one half of the circle leaving a border around it for closing. Close the >> calzone by folding the unfilled side on top of the filled side and crimping the edges closed with your fingers or a fork. Place on a lightly greased baking pan. Let rise approx. 30 minutes. Brush lightly with olive oil and bake at 500 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until puffed and golden. (I bake them at 485 degrees for 15 minutes in my oven.)  The original recipe says to put 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons each or ricotta and grated mozzarella cheese in each calzone. >> My favorite filling is the following......

 SPINACH FILLING : Saute thawed spinach in olive oil and garlic powder until all water has evaporated. (I squeeze out excess liquid first) Mix cheeses into spinach. You may substitute frozen chopped broccoli for spinach.

 I LOVE these!!! I serve them with a spaghetti sauce that has sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc. and they are GREAT! Hope you enjoy them! I used to eat them at the mall and wish I knew how to make them! Let us know what you think!  This recipe that we use is found in Donna German's book II.

                        -----best bread machine cb ever-----
   2 1/2     teaspoons  yeast
       2          cups  bread flour
       1           cup  whole wheat flour
   1 1/2                garlic cloves -- crushed
   1 1/2   tablespoons  sugar

     1/4           cup  parmesan -- grated

     1/2      teaspoon  lemon peel -- grated
   1 1/2          cups  sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  water -- warm

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

 In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

 If Caesar made bread instead of salad dressing, this would be it. Sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes or tuna salad, or serve it with a green salad. For an hors d'oeuvre, toast slices and top with steak tartare or a sliver of rare roast beef. The crusty ends can be cut into croutons, toasted in a frying pan, and tossed in a salad.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  nonfat skim milk
       3   tablespoons  plain yogurt
       1           cup  all-purpose flour

Recipe by: Bread Machine Magic Sourdough Starter: 1.) Heat 1 cup skim (NONFAT) milk to 90-100 degrees 2.) Stir in 3 tbsp. of plain FRESH high quality Yogurt 3.) Pour into a 1 quart glass or ceramic crock, jar or bowl. Cover with a nonmetallic lid and set in a warm place (70-100 degrees F) for 24 hours. (O warm day, you can place the starter outside in the sun or on a kitchen counter. On cooler days, place it in a gas oven with a pilot light or on to of the water heater or on a heating pad set on low) 4.) After 24 hours the milk will thicken and form curds. At this point, gradually stir in 1 cup all purpose flour until blended. Cover with lid and set in a warm place again until it ferments and bubbles and a clear liquid forms on top (about 2 - 5 days) Stir daily. 5.) Starter is now ready to use. Stir, cover loosely, and refrigerate. IF AT ANY TIME IN THE PROCESS THE STARTER TURNS PINK, SMELLS RANCID (NOT JU SOUR) OR DEVELOPS A MOLD, THROW IT OUT AND START OVER.

 Replenishing the Starter: Every time you use some of he starter, you must replace it with a like amount of milk and flour. For instance if you use 1 of starter, return 1 cup of milk AND 1 cup of flour to the jar. Follow these directions for feeding the starter.

 Feeding the starter to keep it alive: A starter should be used as often as possible, at least every 2-3 weeks. If you are not using it that often, pla to feed it once a month to keep it going. 1. Bring to room temperature. 2. Add equal amounts of warm milk (90-100) and flour (1/2-1cup each) 3. Cover with lid and allow to stand in a warm place (70-100 degrees) for twelve to 24 hours until bubbly and a clear liquid has formed on top. 4. Stir, cover loosely (set lid on jar but do not tightly seal; gasses must allow to escape), and refrigerate  Rejuvenating a Neglected Starter: If you forget to feed your starter month don't throw it away thinking its gone bad. Chances are you can still revive it. 1.) pour off the liquid and discard all but 1 to 2 tablespoons of the starter. Temporarily place reserved starter in a bowl. 2.) Wash out the starter container with hot water. 3.) Put the starter back into the container. 4.) Follow the directions for feeding the starter using 1 cup (warm (90- 100'F) skim (nonfat milk ) and 1 cup flour 5. You may have to repeat this procedure once or twice to bring it back up bubbly, sour smelling again.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2    tablespoon  yeast
   2 1/4          cups  flour -- bread
       1           cup  sourdough starter -- room temp
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water -- tepid

Put all ingredients except the water into the machine. Set it for french bread and start it. Slowly drizzle the water into the machine while it is running. Stop adding water when the dough forms a rough ball that cleans the sides of the pan. There should be no wet slime under the paddle. Let it knead for a while. The dough should get smooth and satiny. Touch the dough ball. It's okay if it barely sticks to your finger and feels tacky, but you finger should come away clean. This dough, not having any fat or oil is always just a hair stickier than normal white bread. It should not feel too dry. If it is dry, add a few drops of water. Close the lid and let it do its thing. After the loaf shaping stage you may mist the dough lightly with water to give it a crispier crust.

 Rye variation: substitute 1/2 cup rye flour for 1/2 cup bread flour. Add 1 tsp caraway seed.

 Note: Feed the starter and let it stand at room temp at least 4 hours before starting the bread (usually over night) Store starter in the fridge when not in daily use. I feed it with 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup water.

 Tested in DAK R2D2.  Sylvia's comments: I wanted some sourdough loaves to take to work for a party, and used this one. I shaped the dough into 4 long ropes, which by the time they finished rising were bigger than I wanted. :(  I baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes with a pan of hot water on the bottom rack to get a good crisp crust, then flipped them over and baked another 10 minutes to get the bottom crisp too.  Came out great!

                        -----1-1/2 lb loaf-----
       1           cup  water
   1 1/2      teaspoon  salt (i used 3/4 tsp)
       3           cup  bread flour
       2      teaspoon  yeast
                        cornmeal

***   Slightly adapted for my use from Bread Machine Magic ***  Place all ingredients except cornmeal in breadpan. Select dough setting and start.  At beep, turn dough onto a floured countertop or cutting board. (I spray an acrylic board with Pam and skip the flour). Shape the dough into 12" oblong loaf, 1 large round loaf, 2 18-inch baguettes, or 8 french rolls.

 Dust the top with a little flour; rub it in.  Place on a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm over 30 to 45 minutes of until doubled. To warm oven slightly, turn on warm setting for two minutes then turn it off.  Be sure to remove bread from the oven to preheat.

 Place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 450~. Immediately before placing bread in oven, slash tops with a very sharp knife (I use a serrated knife) about 1/2" deep.

 Bake round or oblong loaves 20 Minutes, baguettes about 15 minutes, french rolls bake 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.

 This is best served within hours of baking.  To preserve crisp crust, do not store in plastic wrap or bags.

   2 2/3           cup  bread flour
   2 1/2      teaspoon  yeast

Set for dough cycle.Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise for only 20 minutes in the machine. Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine. Divide the dough into the appropriate number of pieces. Each piece should be rolled into a rope and made into a circle, pressing the ends together. You may find it necessary to wet one end slightly to help seal the ends together.

 Place these on a well greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring to a slight boil in a "nonaluminum pan", (Donna German uses a cast iron frying pan) about 2 inches of water. Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or dried onion bits if desired and place on the greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes.

 This recipe is from Donna German's first Breadmachine Cookbook, pages 160- 161.

* Mashed Potatoes = Use boiled or instant, but add minced onion, parmesan cheese and horseradish. The dough is very liquid and the bread will not rise very high but it makes a chewy bread similar in texture to a knish or a potato kugel.

Place all ingredients into breadmaker in the order listed. Allow breadmaker to knead and let rise slightly before removing, approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  Don't forget to remove the dough before the bake cycle starts.

 NOTE: I use the DAK Autobakery on the white bread setting to make this dough.  I then remove the dough and place it on a lightly floured cutting board and cover with a clean moist towel to rise an additional 30 minutes or so before forming to the pizza tray.

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 11 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

 For added texture, add oats after the first knead or at the beep on the fruit and nut cycle.  For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats on top of th loaf after the final rise.

 Tried this one yesterday, and not only was it good, it is GONE! I subbed applesauce for the fat with no problems. I've got a loaf working now, also subbing whole-wheat flour for part of the white and with 1/2 c sprouted wheat added.

                     Multi-Grain & Nut Bread

Recipe By     :

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4           cup  bread flour
       1           cup  whole wheat flour
       3    tablespoon  rye flour
       3    tablespoon  yellow cornmeal
     1/3           cup  rolled oats
       3    tablespoon  quaker multi-grain
       2    tablespoon  oat flour
       3    tablespoon  wheat germ (honey crunch)
       1           cup  water
     1/2           cup  milk or cottage cheese
   1 1/2    tablespoon  vegetable oil
       3    tablespoon  honey
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2    tablespoon  vital gluten
   1 1/2      teaspoon  yeast
                        -----add when dough formed-----
     1/4           cup  walnuts(or other) -- chopped
     1/4           cup  sunflower seeds
       1    tablespoon  sesame seeds
       1    tablespoon  poppy seeds
     1/4           cup  carrots -- grated (optional)

Add everything (except the seeds and nuts) to breadbaker in the order appropriate for your machine. I have Panasonic and use VARIETY Cycle which allows me to take the dough out, work with it, then put it back(minus the blade-VERY IMPORTANT) to continue to bake. If you don't have this feature, you can just set it to a dough cycle and finish baking manually. The important thing with this bread is that you have to add the seeds and nuts separately because of the large qty, otherwise they will fly around the machine and make a mess. **For the Panasonic, on the Variety Cycle, it will beep after about 2 hrs. and 20 min. (and will indicate 1:55 on machine). When it beeps, take dough out and put on a floured surface. Also TAKE DOUGH BLADE OUT OF BUCKET. Add the seeds & nuts, carrots too if desired. (Raisins can also be added as well). Work it into the dough, so it is spread fairly evenly. Put back in bucket, and press START. *** You can also roll out dough, place ingredients on top and then roll up the dough, tucking under the ends.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4           cup  all purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2    tablespoon  shortening
       8    tablespoon  dry milk powder
       1            md  egg--slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  sugar
      12         ounce  water
   2 1/2      teaspoon  yeast--active dry *

Add to the breadmachine in order preferred by your machine. (In mine, start with the flour and add dry ingredients first). Yeast should be placed in the yeast dispenser. **note! If you use Fleischmann yeast, increase the amount by 1 teaspoonful!  Run this on your dough cycle. After completion they can be finished one of several ways. One is to take a pinch of dough about the size of a small egg, pull, dip in melted butter, run through sugar/cinnamon mixture and then tie them in a knot.

 Another method is to roll out to about the size of a cookie sheet, spread butter (slightly LESS than a stick) over surface, then top with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll and slice about 1/2 inch thickness. You should get enough for about 3 9" round or sq. pans. I cover the bottom of pans lightly with melted butter--just a small amt! Allow room for them to double in size!  Place in a proofing oven (turn on oven set to 250 for 2 mins then TURN OFF and place rolls in off oven). Let rise till very light and double in bulk (will take about 1 1/2 hrs). Can cover with greased waxed paper. (Do not use towels as they stick!!) Bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees for about 20 mins. Remove from pan at once.

 Can be frozen. Best when eaten warm! Recipe will work as a caramel roll OR even just a plain sweet dinner-like roll. DO NOT use too much butter as they will not rise enough!

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/3           cup  water
   1 1/4      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       3           cup  bread flour
   2 1/2      teaspoon  yeast
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder -- (or to taste)
     1/2      teaspoon  very  coarsely ground pepper
                        (or to taste)
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- up to 1 c

Add the final three ingredients as late as possible in the final kneading stage.  The bread is better if the islands of cheese are identifiable and if the pepper does not get GROUND into the dough by the kneading process.  Cut in 1/2 inch squares

I enjoyed this bread at an Italian restaurant, so I tried to match it as close as I could.  Used the basic recipe fro Italian bread in "The Bread Machine Cookbook" (#1) and added the garlic and pepper.

Good luck.  Hope this works out for you.  Please let me know of your improvements on this very basic recipe.

Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix. Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid; place in refrigerator.

   1 1/2     teaspoons  yeast

This is for the medium sized loaf which, depending on how active my starter is at the moment, will rise to the top of my Hitachi B101.

 If I want an extra sour loaf, I will use the starter two or three days after feeding. This produces a shorter loaf with a heavier texture.

 For a light and fluffy loaf, I feed the starter first, then let it sit on the counter for 8 to 10 hours before using. I make sure it is very foamy when I put it in the B/M.

                     Sourest Sourdough

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4          cups  sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  water
       3          cups  bread flour
       1    tablespoon  olive oil
       2   tablespoons  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2     teaspoons  yeast

Set starter out on counter and bring to room temperature. Feed as you normally do and allow to become foamy and active. This will take 8 to 12 hours.

 Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle is complete, remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. (This rest period makes the dough more pliable.)  Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet or in a special "baguette pan" that can be purchased at a kitchen store. Cover again with the damp towel and put in the refer for 12 to 24 hours. Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it sit out until the loaves are fully risen. (They will usually rise a little in the refer, too.)  Spray again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty. If you want a really crusty bread, spray the loaf with water every five minutes while baking. This harder to describe than it is to do ... and the results are worth it!  PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the temperature, humidity, and the whim of the starter, the bread will vary from ba tch to batch. Sometimes it is very sour and dense while other times it is mildly sour and fluffy inside. Each batch is unique...but it is always good. I found that using the special pan helped the baguettes keep their shape. The pan is well worth the fifteen bucks.

 You can also vary the flavor of the bread by using more or less sugar or by substituting 1 TBL of vinegar for 1 TBL of water. Another variation is to use flat beer instead of water in either the recipe or when feeding the starter.  (Be sure to separate your starter into two batches first so that you do not contaminate the Original pot.)  Everytime I share this recipe, I get notes saying this is the beat sourdough ever!

       1           cup  sourdough starter
       1      teaspoon  salt

Put ingredients in bread machine as suggested by manufacturer.

 Original Poster's Note: Here's one I"ve been tinkering with for several months now. I'm eating a warm slice right now and it's GREAT! :)  The ripe bananas eliminate the need for any sugar or oil. This makes a very tasty loaf that is excellent toasted in the morning or eaten straight out of the bread machine late at night. Hey, I think this may even qualify as healthy stuff.

     2/3           cup  unsweetened whipped cream

FINALLY found the answer to your question about "Babka" recipe for ABM! In "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever" by Madge Rosenberg there is the recipe you are looking for! "Save this giant baba for a special celebration that calls for an impressive dessert that is syrupy and rich."  1. Scald the milk in a small sauce pan and let cool to room temperature. 2. Add the milk and all remaining ingred. for the baba in the order SUGGESTED by YOUR bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's directions. 3. Make a syrup by boiling the sugar & water together in a small saucepan until the mixture is clear. Add the rum and simmer for 1 minute. 4. When the bread cycle ends, remove the warm baba to a deep dish or shallow bowl. Brush the baba with the syrup several times as it cools. Allow the baba to soak up the syrup that collects in the bottom of the dish. Refrigerate until chilled. 5. When cool, slice the baba into wedges and brush them with any remaining syrup if they are not totally moist. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream on the side.

 (my note to you: I copied the recipe just AS IS from the book. I have not made it. The "2/3 C whipped cream 1 cup" was written just that way. It probably means it is 2/3 C. before whipping and 1 cup after whipping. See, it Pays to ask questions on this board!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4          cups  sourdough starter
     1/2           cup  water
       3          cups  bread flour
       1    tablespoon  margarine -- melted
       2   tablespoons  sugar
   1 1/2     teaspoons  salt
       2     teaspoons  yeast

This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I substituted oil for the margarine and with some experimentation, came up with this technique: Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two hours. At the end of two hours, refrigerate the dough, still covered, for at least 12 hours (the longer the better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown and crusty.

Bring bread ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and push Start.

Bake the apple butter right into the bread.  Try substituting any favorite jam or jelly for the apple butter.

Apple's comments: I substituted Peach Butter for the Apple Butter in this recipe and it was delicious.  It has a very nice texture and aroma!  Tested in DAK R2D2.

       1      teaspoon  salt
   3 1/4          cups  bread flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
       1    tablespoon  freshly grated lemon peel
       2     teaspoons  Fleischmann's. Bread Machine Yeast
                        TOPPING
     1/2           cup  almond paste (3 1/2 ounces)
     1/4           cup  bread flour
       1         large  egg -- divided use
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds
       1         whole  clove

To make dough: Measure 2 eggs, milk, butter, water, salt, 3 1/4 cups flour, sugar, lemon peel and yeast into bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Process on dough/manual cycle.

To make topping: Combine almond paste, 1/4 cup flour and 1 egg yolk (reserve egg white); knead 5 to 6 times or until smooth. Form into 1/2-inch balls; set aside.

To shape: When cycle is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Divide dough in half. For wings, roll one half of dough to 10 W 5-inch oval. Arrange in center of greased large baking sheet, curving ends downward. For body, roll remaining half of dough to a triangle, 15 inches high and 6 inches wide (at base); place on center of oval. Fold over top third of triangle from left to right; shape to form dove head. Fold over bottom third of triangle from right to left to form tail. With sharp knife, slash wings and tail at 1-inch intervals to form feathers. 

Lightly beat reserved egg white; brush on dough. Arrange almond paste balls, 1/2 inch apart, on body, tail and wings. Press one slivered almond into each ball. Press clove into head for eye. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.

Bake at 325:F for 35 to 40 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack. 

Description:

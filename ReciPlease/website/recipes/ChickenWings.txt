       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh ground pepper

MIX THE CHILI POWDER, CUMIN, HOT PAPRIKA, OREGANO, SALT AND PEPPER TOGETHER WITH THE BOILING WATER, AND STIR TO MAKE A CHILI PASTE. STIR IN TH KETCHUP AND PEPPER SAUCE. SET ASIDE TO COOL SLIGHTLY. PLACE THE EGGS IN A LARGE BOWL, AND STIR IN THE CHILI PASTE. MIX WELL. CUT THE TAPERED JOINT FROM THE WINGS, AND RESERVE FOR STOCK OR ANOTHER USE. PUT THE TRIMMED WINGS IN THE SPICE EGG MIXTURE. TOSS THOROUGHLY. THE WINGS SHOULD SOAK IN THE MARINADE FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN THE REFRIGERATOR;THE LONGER THEY MARINATE, THE SPICIER THEY WILL BE. HEAT AN INCH OF OIL IN A HEAVY SKILLET TO 375 DEGREES.(IT'S THE PROPER TEMPERATURE WHEN A WING TIP DIPPED IN THE OIL CAUSES AN IMMEDIATE BUBBLING) FRY THE WINGS IN BATCHES FOR ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES, FLIPPING ONCE DURING COOKING. BE SURE NOT TO CROWD THE PAN. DRAIN ON PAPER TOWELS. SERVE HOT OR CHILLED

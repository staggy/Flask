--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  soy bean curd (canned or Fresh)
       2                green onions
     1/2      teaspoon  minced garlic
       2   tablespoons  peanut oil
     1/2           cup  chicken stock

       2   tablespoons  premium oyster sauce
                        Cornstarch paste
       1      teaspoon  peanut oil

Slice bean curd into 1/4" cubes; sliver green onions. In hot wok, heat oil just to point of smoking. Add bean curd, green onions and garlic. 

Stir gently to avoid breaking up curd; turn pieces to coat with oil. Be sure oil is not too hot or curd will tend to stick to pan.

When aroma of garlic is apparent, add stock and bring to boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 30 seconds (don't let curd fall apart). Remove cover; stir in oyster sauce and sugar.

Increase heat, and when liquid boils again, add enough cornstarch paste to make a creamy (but not too thick) sauce. 

Swirl in peanut oil to make a glaze. Serve over rice or in a shallow serving bowl.

       5                (5 to 6) duck webs
     1/2         pound  Broccoli
       2                (2 to 3) Chinese dried mushrooms -- soaked
       2        slices  Ginger root -- peeled
       2                Scallions (spring onions)
       2   tablespoons  Rice wine (or sherry)
       1      teaspoon  Soy sauce
     1/2    tablespoon  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt

       1      teaspoon  Sesame seed oil
       1    tablespoon  Cornstarch (corn flour)
       4   tablespoons  Oil

Remove the outer skin of the duck webs; wash and clean well. Crush the ginger root and onions. Heat up 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil; toss in the crushed ginger root and onions followed by the duck webs; stir a few times; add rice wine or sherry and soy sauce. After 5 minutes or so, transfer the entire contents to a sand-pot or casserole.

Add sugar, a little salt, star anise and a little stock or water. Simmer gently for 3 hours. Just before serving, stir-fry the broccoli or greens with the Chinese dried mushrooms, a little salt and sugar. Place them on a serving dish, then arrange the duck webs on top of that.

Meanwhile heat a little oil in a saucepan, add oyster sauce and sesame seed oil. Thicken with cornstarch (corn flour) mixed with a little cold water; when it is smooth, pour it over the duck webs and serve. The oyster sauce enriches the subtle taste of the duck webs.

                     Romaine Lettuce with Oyster Sauce

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : Chinese                          Salad                            
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1          head  Romaine lettuce
     1/4      teaspoon  Salt
       2   tablespoons  Peanut oil
       1    tablespoon  Premium oyster sauce

We decided on romaine lettuce for this dish because it is crisp textured, and readily available. Wash; remove core from lettuce.

Combine oil; oyster sauce in small sauce pan; bring to simmer; keep hot until ready to serve. Blanching: Heat about 2 gallons water in large pot. We use bottom of aluminum steamer.

Add salt. When water reaches rolling boil, blanch lettuce for about 20 seconds until leaves are bright green. Remove leaves, shake off excess water.

Stack leaves; cut cross-wise into 4 parts. Use cleaver to place leaves on serving platter. Pour hot oyster sauce on leaves. Serve.

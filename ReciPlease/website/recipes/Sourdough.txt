--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1      teaspoon  red star yeast
   2 1/3          cups  bread flour
     1/4           cup  rye flour
       1    tablespoon  lecithin granules
       1    tablespoon  gluten
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  dill weed (dried)
       1      teaspoon  dried onion flakes
     1/2           cup  water
       1           cup  sourdough starter*

I just realized that I never added any sugar or dry milk. It doesn't seem to miss them.  Next time I'll add more dill and onion. The jars were almost empty when my baking fit struck me, so I went with what I had.

 I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of the pan and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.

 *Starter:  2c all purpose flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pk yeast. Combined and left in oven all night with the light on. It doesn't have a name yet. Would "Bubbles" be too optimistic?

Sift dry ingredients, stir into liquid, roll out and cut with regular donut cutter.  Then heat some oil in a deep fryer to 390 degrees F and fry. Makes about 17 Doughnuts with holes. Just before serving dust with powdered or cinnamon sugar. NOTE: These doughnuts are virtually greaseless. And if you want you can make several batches at a time and freeze. They keep well and to me taste better after awhile in the freezer. Take out as many as needed and thaw and put sugar on or eat plain.

I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat bread recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just halved your recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour model, is yours? If I'm using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add more flour because it doesn't rise as much.  Also, whenever I use whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I put in the DAK and the order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one) Later, at the beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didn't have walnuts on hand). I usually add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while knead ing. We can keep experimenting with this....let me know if you try it and what you add or subtract. Have you ever added raisins, oatmeal or any kind of seeds? The B/M gives me the lazy way out, and I wanted to see what it would do in it.  Thanks so much for taking precious  time to post the recipe. P.S. I have some of the beer s/d starter to give you when we get together, but the whole wheat starter is GREAT!. Regards, 08/21 11:14 P.M. JUDY/NC PJXG05A

       2          cups  warm milk
       1    tablespoon  butter
       1       package  active dry yeast
     1/4           cup  honey

       2   tablespoons  sugar
       2     teaspoons  salt
       2     teaspoons  baking soda

Mix the starter and 2 1/2 Cups of the flour and all the water the night before you want to bake. Let stand in warm place overnight. Next morning mix in the butter with warm milk and stir in yeast until dissolved. Add honey and when thoroughly mixed, add 2 more cups of flour, and stir in the wheat germ. Sprinkle sugar, salt, and baking soda over the mixture. Gentlypress into dough and  mix lightly. Allow to stand from 30 to 50 minutes until mixture is bubbly. Add enough flour until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl. Then place the dough on a lightly floured board and knead 100 times or until silky mixture is developed. Form into 4 1-lb loaves, place in well-greased loaf pans 9 x 3 size. Let rise until double, about 2 to 3 hours in a warm room. Then bake in hot oven, 400 degrees F, for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temp. to 325 degrees F. and bake 20 minutes longer or until thoroughly baked. Remove from pans and place loaves on rack to cool.  Butter tops of loaves to prevent hard crustyness. Makes 4 1-lb loaves

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  nonfat or lowfat milk
       2   tablespoons  lowfat regular plain yogurt
       1           cup  flour

Heat 1 cup nonfat or lowfat milk to 90-100 F (nonfat milk gives the most tang, whole milk the least). Remove from heat and stir in 2 T freshly opened lowfat or regular plain yogurt (lowfat gives the tangiest flavor).

 Pour mixture into a warmed (rinse with hot water for several minutes) 1 1/2 qt container, cover tightly, and let stand in a warm place at 80-100 F. (Above 110 F, the bacteria may be killed; below 70 F, the bacteria don't grow well.)  After 18-24 hrs, starter should be about the consistency of yogurt. If some clear liquid rises to the top, simply stir it back in. However, if liquid is light pink in color, milk is beginning to break down; discard and begin again.

 After a curd has formed, gradually stir one cup flour into starter until smoothly blended.  Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place (80-100 F is ideal) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good sour smell; this takes 2-5 days.

 During this time, if clear liquid forms, stir it back into the starter. But if liquid turns pink, spoon out and discard all but 1/4 cup of starter, then blend in a mixture of 1 cup of lukewarm milk (90-100 F) and 1 cup flour.  Cover tightly and let stand again in a warm place until bubble and sour smelling.  Use.  Or, cover and store in refrigerator.

 To maintain your supply, each time you use 1 cup of starter, replenish it with 1 cup lukewarm (90-100 F) milk and 1 cup flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is bubbly again, several hours or until next day.  Then cover and refrigerate until the next use. Before using starter, always let it warm to room temperature; this takes 4-6 hrs. If you want to bake in the morning, leave the starter out the night before.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  skim or lowfat milk
       3   tablespoons  yogurt -- plain or low-fat

Warm a 1 1/2 quart glass, ceramic, rigid plastic, or stainless steel container by filling it with hot water and letting it stand for several minutes; wipe dry. Heat 1 cup skim or lo-fat milk to 90-100  on a thermometer. Remove from heat and stir in 3 tablespoons plain unflavored, lo-fat yogurt. Pour into warm container, cover tightly, and let stand in a warm place (80 - 100 ). After 18 to 24 hours, starter should be about the consistency of yogurt (a curd forms and mixture does not flow readily when container is slightly tilted). During this time, if some clear liquid rises to top of milk, simply stir it back in. However, if liquid has turned light pink, it indicates that the milk is beginning to break down; discard and try again. After a curd has formed, gradually stir 1 cup all purpose flour into starter until smooth. Cover tightly and let stand in a warm place (80 - 100 ) until mixture is full of bubbles and has a good sour smell; this takes 2 to 5 days. During this time if clear liquid forms, stir it back into starter. /But if liquid turns pink, spoon out and discard all but 1/4 cup starter; thin blend in a mixture of 1 cup each warm milk (90 - 100 ) and flour. Cover tightly and let stand in warm place until bubbly and sour smelling; then it is ready to use. To store, cover and refrigerate. Makes about 1 1/2 cups starter. To maintain an ample supply, replenish your starter every time you use it. Do this by adding a mixture of 1/2 cup each warm milk (90 - 100 ) and flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place for several hours or until next day; mixture should be full of bubbles again. Store covered in refrigerator. For consistent flavor, continue using the same type of milk you originally used. Always let your starter come to room temperature before using it; this takes 4 to 6 hours. If you plan to bake in the morning, leave it out the night before. If you bake regularly- about once a week - the starter should keep lively and active. You can check your starter occasionally to see if its active by spooning out about 1/4 cup of the starter and mixing it with 1/2 cup each warm milk (90  - 100 ) and flour. Cover and let stand in a warm spot. Check often; it should bubble again in 4 to 8 hours. You can combine this mixture with the original starter after the test. If  you don't bake often, its best to discard about half your starter and replenish it with warm milk and flour about every 2 months to keep it active. The feel of dough containing sourdough starter is slightly tacky when lightly touched.

Let milk stand for a day or so in an uncovered container at room temperature.  Add flour to milk and let stand for another couple of days. When it starts working well and smells right, it is ready to use. NOTE: All containers for starters not using yeast, must be carefully scalded before use.  If you are carless or do not scald them the starter will fail.

Boil some potatoes for supper, save the potato water, and use it lukewarm with enough unbleached flour to make a thick batter. without yeast. This is a good way to make it in camp, where you have no yeast available and want fast results.  This is also the way most farm girls made it in the olden days.  Let stand a day or so, or until it smells right.

                        castillo   (hjdd64b)
       1           cup  sourdough starter
       1    tablespoon  sea salt
       2      packages  dry yeast
       5          cups  whole wheat flour -- to 6 c.
     1/2           cup  warm water (110f)
       2                eggs -- beaten
   1 1/4          cups  boiling water
       6   tablespoons  rolled oats
       1           cup  rolled oats
       1                egg white -- beaten
     2/3           cup  light molasses -- (or honey)
       1    tablespoon  water
     1/3           cup  safflower oil

Measure out sourdough starter. Soften yeast in warm water. Combine boiling water, oats, molasses, oil and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Stir in 2 c. flour. Beat well. Add to sourdough starter along with softened yeast and eggs. Stir in enough of remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5 - 8 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Shape dough into a ball and place in lightly greased bowl, turning once. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from drafts and let rise 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in size. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Coat 2 well greased loaf pans with about 3 tbsp oats per pan. Shape dough into loaves and place in pans. Cover and let rise in warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled in size. Brush loaves with mixture of egg white and water. Sprinkle tops lightly with rolled oats. Bake at 375F for 40 to 50 minutes or until done(I find mine are always done at  35 minutes so watch carefully). Makes 2 loaves.

(CONTINUED) TROUBLESHOOTING  Feeding Without Baking:  "If you have been busy or away, you can always feed your starter without baking anything. Stir the mixture together, take out and discard 1 cup of starter and replenish as above, stirring in 1 cup water and 1 cup flour. (Or instead of discarding the starter you removed, ask a neighbor if he or she would be interested in adopting a starter of his/her very own.)  Let the resuscitated mixture sit at room temperature for 12 hours or so before you return it to the refrigerator."  Treating a "Sluggish" Starter:  "If you feel that your starter is just not "up to snuff," dissolve a teaspoon of yeast in the cup of water you mix into the starter when you feed it. (If you live in an area where water is chlorinated, let some sit out overnight to allow the chlorine to dissipate to preclude any interference with the development of the sourdough micro-organisms)."  Sweetening a Starter:  "If your starter becomes too sour, take out 1 cup, dispose of the remainder, and ad d 2 cups of each of flour and water to refreshen it."  Increasing Your Starter:  "If you want to grow a large amount of starter to give some to a friend or to do a lot of baking, simply increase the amount you feed it."  Resuscitating a Neglected Starter:  "If your sourdough starter has sat in the refrigerator months beyond the point of health, give it a fighting chance for survival before you throw it out. A little warmth and a good meal of strong, high energy carbohydrates may be all it needs to get it off and running again."  "The layer of liquid on the surface will probably be very dark, making it look as if the starter must surely have expired. Quell your fear, wrestle the top off the jar and give it a sniff. If it smells the way it should, though exceptionally sour, it may just be sitting there in a dormant state waiting to be fed. The only way to know is to give it a meal."  "Blend it back together and pour it into a glass or ceramic bowl. (Take this opportunity to give its jar a good wash.) As the st arter will probably be quite thin, mix in 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of water to nourish and thicken it. Leave the bowl out on the counter where it will be warm and visible."

(CONTINUED) Storing Your Starter:

 "Once your sourdough pet is cold and relatively dormant, it can survive quite a long time between "feedings." It is certainly not as demanding as children, or more traditional pets, but it isn't happy just sitting for months on end like a packet of commercially dried yeast either."  "Freezing:  You may be able to ignore your starter for a month or even much longer, but if you know you're going to be away for a time, you can store it (unlike children or pets) in the freezer. You may want to transfer it to a plastic container first as it will expand as it freezes. When you are ready to use it again, give it a day to revive, feed it a good meal, give it another day to build up an armada of fresh, new wild siblings and it will be ready to go to work."  "Drying:  An alternative storage method is to dry your starter by spreading it out on a piece of heavy plastic wrap or waxed paper. Once it's dry, crumble it up and put it in an airtight container. Store it some place cool, or, to be safe, in the freezer. To reach pivot the dried starter, grind it into small particles with a hand cranked grinder, a blender or a food processor.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 cups of warm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) into a glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in and dissolve a tablespoon of sugar or honey. This isn't necessary but it gives the yeast an easy "first course."  Blend in an equal amount of flour and dried starter.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and watch for small telltale bubbles which should begin to appear on the surface within a few hours. Once you see them you'll know it's alive and well. Let it continue to feed and grow for a further 12 hours before you cover and refrigerate it."  How to Remove Some Starter for Baking:

 "With a spoon or wire whisk, blend the liquid back into the starter and then measure out the quantity required by your recipe. Replace the amount taken with equal amounts of flour and water. Since many recipes are based on using 1 cup of starter, you would return to your starter pot, 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water. (This actually makes 1 1/3 cups more starter but you can adjust the amount whenever you want.) As you did when you first fed your starter, let it sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a chance to "feed" and multiply before you chill it again."

(Continued) How to Feed & Care for Your Sourdough Starter:

 "Keeping a sourdough starter is somewhat like having a pet because it needs to be fed and cared for.  But its requirements are simple and not time consuming. Baking with sourdough is also a simple process. All it takes is a little planning and timing. The results are so satisfying, you'll grow to treasure your invisible pet the way our ancestors did."  "When you receive your starter, refrigerate it if you don't intend to feed it immediately (at any rate, starter should be fed as soon as possible after you receive it). To feed it for the first time, snip off a corner of the plastic bag and squeeze the starter into a glass or ceramic bowl (not metal).  Stir in 3 cups of lukewarm water (what feels comfortable on your wrist) and 3 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour. Mix until it's well blended and the consistency of pancake batter. Let the replenished starter sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a chance to multiply and become active before you put it in the refrigerator. Ordinarily  you would feed your starter when you remove some to bake with it.  A good rule of thumb is to replenish it every two weeks or so, preferably because you made a wonderful loaf of sourdough bread, a stack of pancakes or a delicious sourdough cake." (This previous paragraph is for those people who have ordered King Arthur's Sourdough Starter from their ca talog.)  "During the time the starter is stored in the refrigerator, it becomes relatively dormant which is why it can survive so long with so little attention. You'll find that a clear, amber colored liquid will accumulate on the surface of the starter. This liquid contains 12% to 14% alcohol."  "When yeast is in contact with air, it produces carbon dioxide; when it's not, it produces alcohol.  When you blend the alcohol back into the starter, it helps produce the unique flavor you find in good sourdough breads.  For milder flavor, you can pour off some of the alcohol if you wish although this will thicken the starter requiring a bit more liquid to return it  to its "pancake batter" consistency. (To "sweeten" a starter in another way, see Troubleshooting which follows.) The alcohol itself dissipates during the baking process."  (Continued)

The following information comes from King Arthur Flour "A Short Course in Cooking With & Keeping the Elusive Wild Yeast".

 What is a Sourdough Starter?  "A sourdough starter is a wild yeast living in a batter of flour and liquid.  Yeasts are microscopic fungi related distantly to mushrooms. There are many varieties of these tiny organisms around us everywhere. Wild yeasts are rugged individualists which can withstand the most extreme of circumstances. Some will make delicious loaves of bread; others will create yogurt and cheese out of milk; still others will turn the juices of grains and fruit into beer and wine."  "Active dry yeast, the kind we can buy in packets at our grocer's, is a domesticated descendant of these wild relatives, one which has been grown for flavor, speed of growth and predictability. But domestic yeasts are much more fragile and can't be grown at home without eventually reverting to their original wild state."  "If you can imagine a world without any packets of active dry yeast, you can imagine how important your sourdough starter would be to you. Without it, you would be doomed to some pretty awful eating. It is no wonder that sourdough starters were treasured, fought over, and carried to all ends of the earth.  To the early prospectors, it was such a valued possession (almost more than the gold they were seeking), that they slept with it on frigid winter nights to keep it from freezing. (Ironically, freezing won't kill a sourdough starter although too much heat will.)"  Fermentation (or the Microscopic Magic of Yeast): "As we mentioned above, yeast is a microscopic fungus.  As it feeds on the natural sugars in grain, it multiplies and gives off carbon dioxide (just as we do when we breathe). This invisible activity of yeast is called fermentation. When you make bread with wheat, by kneading the long elastic strands of wheat protein (called gluten) into an elastic mesh, you create traps for these carbon dioxide bubbles causing the dough to expand as if it contained a million tiny balloons."

You will find that your sourdough breads will have more "tang" and will rise higher in the BM if you follow this procedure: * Remove a cup )or more) of your starter from the fridge and bring to room temp. * Feed with 1 cup flour and 1 cup (or slightly less) water * Let the starter do its thing. It will become bubbly and foamy. Watch for its 'peak'. This usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after feeding. It is best to keep the starter warm (75 to 85 degrees). If it cold out, leave it in the oven with the light turned on! * Make your bread during the peak...while the starter is VERY active. * Dump the unused starter back into the mother pot. Following this method, you can even make sourdough in the b/m without yeast. Really! *Variation: Separate your starter into two batches. Create a "beer" starter with one batch. You will feed this pot with flat beer and flour instead of water and flour. A very unique and delicious taste! * To create your own sourdough recipe: Substitute 7/8 cup start for 1 cup liquid Reduce flour  by 1/4 to 1/2 cup

     5/8           cup  water -- (for welbilt/dak no
                        water needed)
       1           cup  sourdough starter
       3          cups  bread flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       2     teaspoons  red star yeast -- (except for
                        machines -- use 4 ts)
                        cornmeal -- (optional)

Recipe for 1.5 lb loaf.

 For a mild sourdough: Place all ingredients except cornmeal in pan, select Dough setting and press Start.

 For the sourest sourdough: In a medium bowl, combine the water, starter (room temp), and half of the flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place until very sour and bubbly, from 24 to 48 hours. Then combine mixture with the rest of the ingredients except cornmeal in pan. Select Dough setting and press Start. When dough has risen long enough the machine will beep. Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan and turn out dough on floured countertop or cutting board. Shape dough into one 12" oblong loaf or one large round loaf or two 18" thin baguettes or eight french rolls.

 Place loaf (loaves) on a baking sheet that is well greased or sprinkled with cornmeal. With a sharp knife or razor blade, slash the rolls or baguettes straight down the center about 1/2" deep. On the oblong loaf, make 3 diagonal slashes. On the round loaf, slash and X or # on top. Let rise in warm oven 30-45 minutes until doubled. (Hint: to warm oven slightly, turn oven on Warm for 2 minutes, then turn it off, and place covered dough in oven to rise. Remove pan from oven to preheat it)  Preheat oven to 400F. With a plant mister, mist each loaf with water (or brush with water). Bake 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown, misting with water twice more at 5-minute intervals. Remove from oven, cool on wire racks. To preserve crisp crust, do not store in plastic wrap or bags. Bread can be loosely covered or left out for up to 2 days before it dries out completely.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  active starter
       1           cup  milk
   2 1/2          cups  flour
     1/3           cup  lard or shortening
       1    tablespoon  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
       2     teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

At bedtime make a batter of the half cup of starter, cup of milk, and 1 cup of the flour.  Let set overnight if the biscuits are wanted for breakfast. If wanted for noon, the batter maybe mixed in the morning and set in a warm place to rise.  However, unless the weather is real warm, it is always all right to let it ferment overnight. It will get very light and bubbly. When ready to mix the biscuits, sift together the remaining cup and a half of flour and all other dry ingredients except the baking soda. Work in the lard or shortening with your fingers or a fork. Add baking soda dissolved in a little warm water to the sponge and then add the flour mixture. Mix into a soft dough. Knead lightly a few times to get in shape. Roll out to about 1/2 inch thickness or a little thicker,and cut with a biscuit cutter. Place close together in a 9 x 13-inch pan, turning to grease tops. Cover and set in a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes. Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes. Leftovers are good split and toasted in a sandwich toaster.

(CONTINUED) "In a couple of hours you may see tiny bubbles appear on the surface.  If so, cheer your brew on by keeping it warm and covered overnight.  In the morning, celebrate by making sourdough pancakes (which you'll find ...in our "King Arthur  Flour 200th Anniversary Cookbook").  They are delicious and quick. Give the remaining starter another feeding, let it sit for 12 more hours to ensure its reawakened vigor before you tuck it back in the frig. Then quietly heave a sigh of relief and congratulate yourself on your rescue." How to Decide if You Need to Start Over (groan):

 "If your sourdough begins to mold or develop a peculiar color or odor instead of a "clean, sour aroma," give a sigh, throw it out and, if you're patient, start again. Along with the vital yeasts, you may have inadvertently nurtured a strain of bacteria that will not be wonderful in food.  This happens very infrequently so don't let this possibility dissuade you from a sourdough adventure."  Starter Variations:

 "Here are some variations on the basic flour/liquid/yeast combination that will produce sourdough starters with different personalities.

 *Substitute 1 cup of stone ground whole wheat flour for 1 of the unbleached all-purpose flour.

 *For tap water, substitute water from cooking potatoes. It contains nutrients which any kind of yeast loves and along with making the yeast happy, it creates great flavor in bread.

 *Substitute buttermilk for tap water.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/2          cups  primary sourdough batter b*
   1 3/4          cups  flour
       1      teaspoon  -- salt
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       3   tablespoons  salad oil
       2                eggs
       2   tablespoons  sugar in 4 qts boiling water

*Prepare Primary Sourdough Batter B according to recipe. Be sure that you have saved 1 cup starter separately. Let all ingreds come to room temp. Sift 1 1/2 c flour, salt, & sugar into warm bowl. Stir in salad oil & eggs. Stir in Primary Batter B & add enough additional flour for dough to leave sides of bowl. Turn dough onto well floured board & knead in enough additional flour to make dough smooth & elastic (abt 1/4 c). Place in warm greased bowl, cover & set bowl in warm 85F spot until doubled in bulk. This will take abt. 2 hrs. When doubled, punch down & let proof for an additional 1 1/2 hrs or until doubled in bulk.

 Turn dough out onto floured board & divide it into 12-14 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-" roll abt 3/4 " thick. Pinch the 2 ends together to form a doughnut shape. Boil 4 qts water & add 2 tb sugar. Drop each bagel into boiling water 1 at a time. Boil only 4 at a time. Cook until they rise to the top & then turn over & cook for 2 mins longer. [DG NOTE- don't cook longer than 3 mins or they get tough.] Remove w/slotted spoon & place on greased cookie sheet. When all have been boiled, put in preheated 375F oven & bake for 20-25 mins until crusty & golden brown. Makes 12-14 bagels. Adventures in San Francisco by Charles D.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  sourdough starter
   2 1/2          cups  flour
       2          cups  warm water
   3 3/4             c  flour -- (3 3/4 to 4 1/4)
       3   tablespoons  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
       3   tablespoons  vegetable oil

Cold water  Mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until smooth. Cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. Add 3-3/4 C flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in bowl. Stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely absorbed. (Dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. If necessary, add remaining 1/2 C flour gradually, stirring until all flour is absorbed.) Turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1-1/2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.) Punch dough down; divide into halves. Shape each half into a round,  slightly flat loaf. Do not tear dough by pulling. Place loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. Make three 1/4" deep slashes in each loaf. Let rise until double, about 45 minutes. Heat oven to 375. Brush loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet in center  of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. Bake, brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when tapped, about 50 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire racks.

 Be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take longer than the estimated times given.

       1           cup  water
       1           cup  milk
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  salt
       2          cups  flour
       1    tablespoon  white vinegar

Mix all together, and let sit on your counter for 3 days with a loose fitting lid or cover with Saran Wrap. On the third day stir it well. Let sit for two more days. Some recipes call for adding 1 packet of yeast that has been dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water on the fifth day. It sort of speeds up the process of it getting sour. If you do add it, then let the mix sit out for at least one more week, stirring it every day. If you don't add it, you still have to let it sit out a week, but, it may not be as sour the first few times you use it. Store starter in the fridge. It will separate, into two parts, a darkish liquid on the top ~ this is normal. Before you use it, stir the liquid back into the bottom part. ALWAYS use a wooden or plastic spoon. NEVER use metal. Always use glass, ceramic or plastic bowls...NEVER metal. To use:   Pour out the amount needed. For 1/2 cup starter used, feed with 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir in well. Don't worry about flour lumps etc. Let sit out on the counter with a loose lid overnight! Stir, return to refrigerator. (According to Cheryl & Connie, you have to wait at least 3 or 4 days between used!) IF you don't use within a week, feed starter 1 teaspoon sugar, stir in and return to fridge. It's NOT that hard...and of all the starters I've used, this one so far has been the best. Thanks Cheryl and Connie!

                     French Sourdough Bread

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time : 0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  yeast -- (or 1 1/2 tsp)
       3          cups  bread flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  sugar
       1    tablespoon  cornmeal
       1    tablespoon  gluten
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  sourdough starter
       2     teaspoons  olive oil or butter
       1           cup  warm water

Put all ingreds. in order listed into pan, select "French" bread and push Start.  Tip: If you can, open lid and check while kneading to feel whether the dough is too wet or dry. Correct it with a Tbsp. or so of water or flour. Since you have made so much bread, you know how the dough should feel. FROM:    JUDY GARNETT (PJXG05A)

                     Classic Sourdough Bread

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time : 0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1           cup  sourdough starter
   1 1/3          cups  warm water
       5             c  all-purpose flour or -- a combination of (5
                        to 6)
                        and whole -- wheat flours
       1    tablespoon  salt
       1    tablespoon  sugar
       1      teaspoon  baking soda -- cornmeal to sprinkle

THE SPONGE:

 Pour 1 c of starter into a large ceramic mixing bowl. Feed and then refrigerate the remainder. Add to the starter in the mixing bowl, the warm water and about 3 c of flour. Beat vigorously with a spoon or wire whisk. Cover this sponge with plastic wrap and put it aside to work. This time period can be very flexible, but allow at least 2 hours and as many as 24. The longer it has, the more yeast there will be for the second rise and the more pronounced the sour flavor of the bread will be.

 THE DOUGH:

 After sponge has bubbled and expanded, remove plastic wrap. Blend salt, sugar and baking soda into 2 c of flour. Mix this into sponge with large spoon. When dough begins to hold together, turn it out onto floured board and knead it for 3 or 4 minutes. Add flour as needed to make a fairly stiff dough. Give the dough a rest and clean the bowl. Continue kneading for another 3 or 4 minutes. Place the dough back in the bowl turning it to grease the top. Cover and let rise for 2 to 4 hours.If you want, you can skip the second rise in the bowl and proceed directly to the next step.

 SHAPING AND BAKING THE LOAVES:

 Knock down the dough and shape it into 2 long loaves. Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled cookie sheet, cover and let them rise for another 2 hours or so.Toward the end of the rising period, preheat your oven to 450F and begin heating a kettle of water on your stove. Just before you put them in the oven, slash the tops of your loaves diagonally with a knife 1/4" deep every two inches and brush with cold water.Place a baking pan on the oven bottom and put in 3 or 4 cups of boiling water. Put the loaves on the rack over the steaming water, close the oven and bake for about 25 minutes.

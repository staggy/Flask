       1           cup  butter -- softened
       7        ounces  almond paste
       1           cup  powdered sugar
       2                egg yolks
       1      teaspoon  almond extract
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
       2          cups  all-purpose flour

       1    tablespoon  shortening
       1           cup  almonds -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; line cookie sheets with parchment paper.  In a large mixer bowl, combine the butter and almond paste.  Beat on low speed, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Add the powdered sugar, egg yolks, almond extract and vanilla extract.  Beat on medium speed, scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Reduce the speed to low. Continue beating, gradually adding the flour and scraping the bowl often, for 1 to 2 minutes until well mixed.  Place the dough in a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch opening.  Pipe onto the cookie sheets forming 2 1/2 to 3-inch logs.  Bake for 13 to 17 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly browned.  Cool completely on parchment paper.  In a 1-quart saucepan, melt the chocolate chips and shortening over low heat, stirring often, for 5 to 8 minutes until smooth. Remove the cooled cookies from the parchment paper and dip the ends or the tops in the chocolate and then in the almonds.  Place on waxed paper until set.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).

Put the ingredients in large bowl. Mash, squeeze, knead, etc until it is completely blended. Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat. Bake at 350 degrees for about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe to use when you need to get rid of some aggressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So you have to use your hands and beat it!!  You can also use peanut butter or butterscotch chips or a mixture of them.

       1      teaspoon  baking powder
                        spices*

*Use 1 teaspoon of each spice: ground ginger, ground allspice, ground cinnamon and ground cloves. 1-In a large bowl, at low speed, beat butter, brown sugar and molasses until light and fluffy. Add egg and remaining ingredients. Beat at low speed until well mixed, constantly scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Shape dough into a ball, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill 3-4 hours. 2-Lightly grease 2 large cookie sheets, turn oven to 350. On lightly floured surface using a floured rolling pin, roll 1/2 of dough 1/4-inch thick. Keep other half refrigerated. With a 3-inch cookie cutter, cat as many cookies as you can; reserve trimmings. With pancake turner, carefully place cookies on cookie sheets. Bake for 12 minutes or until edges are light brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Repeat with other half of dough and trimmings. 3-Prepare FROSTING: In a large bowl using mixer at low speed beat 5 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 4 egg whites just until mixed. Turn speed to high and beat until stiff. Divide dough into small bowls and tint each with food coloring of your choice. If necessary, add a little water for spreading ease. Keep all bowls covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. 4-Decorate cookies: place cookies on waxed paper lined cookie sheets. With small and medium artist's brushes, paint the cookies. Allow cookies to dry completely, about 2 hours. Store in tightly covered containers. First Place winner, Sarah Cristal,age 13, Spring Valley Ca at the Del Mar county fair 1993.

       4          cups  all-purpose flour
       1                egg yolk

Dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm milk, making certain that the milk is not too warm.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside.  In a deep mixing bowl, combine the butter, remaining sugar, salt and scalded milk, and stir until all are blended.  When lukewarm, stir in the yeast.  Add the eggs and about 2 cups of the flour, and beat to a smooth batter.  Add remaining flour to make a tender dough.  Turn out on a floured board and knead for about 2 minutes.  Grease a large mixing bowl; grease whole surface of the large ball of dough and place dough in bowl.  Cover.  Let rise in a warm, not hot, place, to double its bulk. (Takes from 2 to 4 hours.)  Again knead on a floured board for about a minute.  Roll out 1/8 of an inch thick.  Cut into 3- to 4-inch circles.

Place filling on each.  Recipe for Mohn Filling follow.  To shape true hamantaschen, pinch edges of a circle together over filling, leaving about 1/2 open, forming a cornucopia.  Then fold over the flap and pinch these edges firmly together.  Arrange well apart on a greased cookie sheet.  Cover with a cloth and let rise again in a warm place to double in bulk.  Brush tops with the egg yolk, thinned with a little water.  Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 15 to 20 minutes.  Makes 2 to 2 1/2 dozen.

Beat together butter and sugar in small bowl with electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, lemon peel, vanilla and salt. Gradually beat in flour until thoroughly incorporated. Add water, a few drops at a time, only until dough starts to come away from side of bowl. Wrap dough in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350 deg. Lightly grease 4 cookie sheets.  On lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8" thickness. Cut out var-ious shapes using cookie cutters or homemade cardboard patterns, or free- hand. Reroll scraps and cut out. Make small holes with wooden pick if planning to hang cookies.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until beginning to brown around edges. Remove cookies to wire rack to cool before decorating.  Prepare icing: Beat egg whites in small bowl with electric mixer until foamy. Slowly beat in the powdered sugar. Continue to beat until thick and creamy. Add just enough water to get a good spreading consistency. Tint with food coloring, if you wish. Spread evenly over cookies.  Decorate with glitter, sprinkles, dragees and cinnamon red hots.

       1           cup  butter or margarine -- softened
       3        ounces  cream cheese -- softened
       8   tablespoons  honey -- divided
       2          cups  all-purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  lemon juice
       1      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
       1           cup  almonds -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  dried cherries -- or cranberries

In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter and cream cheese until fluffy.  Add 3 tablespoons honey and mix well.  Mix in the flour until the dough holds together.  Form the dough into a ball; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.      Preheat oven to 350 degrees; line cookie sheets with parchment paper and grease the parchment.  Divide the dough into fourths.  On a lightly floured surface, with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough, one piece at a time, into a 9-inch circle.  In a small bowl or cup, combine 2 tablespoons honey and lemon juice; mix well.  Brush the dough with some of the honey mixture; sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over the entire surface.  In another small bowl, combine the almonds, dried cherries and the remaining 3 tablespoons honey; mix well.  Spread 1/4 the almond mixture onto the circle of dough, stopping 1/2-inch from the outer edge.  Cut the circle into eight wedges.  Starting at the wide outer edge, roll up each triangle jelly roll style, toward the tip.  Gently bend both ends to form a crescent. Place on prepared cookie sheet; refrigerate for 20 minutes or longer.  Repeat with the remaining dough, honey-lemon mixture, cinnamon and filling.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove from the pan and cool on wire racks.  Unbaked crescents may be stored in a freezer-safe container or bags and frozen for up to 3 months.  Thaw before baking.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       4        ounces  semisweet chocolate
       1         ounce  unsweetened chocolate
   2 1/3          cups  sifted all-purpose flour
   1 1/2     teaspoons  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4         pound  unsalted butter
       1           cup  granulated sugar
       1    tablespoon  vanilla extract
       2                egg
       1    tablespoon  milk
     3/4           cup  finely chopped walnuts

1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the flour, baking soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. 3.  In the bowl of a mixer, cream the butter. Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat. Add the vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate and stir to blend. 4.  Stir in the dry ingredients and the milk by hand. When just blended, mix in the walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough for 30 minutes before rolling. 5.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a cookie sheet. 6.  To form the cookies, scoop out a portion of dough and roll out on a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch thick, cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll scraps and cut again. 7.  Place on cookie sheet (leave room for expansion) and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch for any hot spots in the oven and don't let these cookies overbrown. VARIATION:  For the Brownie Cookie Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the dough briefly. Lightly grease the back side of a large baking sheet. Roll the dough out onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked product will crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and  cool completely. Roll over the cookie with a rolling pin until it is crushed to a fine crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of crumbs.)  Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix it into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse" recipe by using a large muffin pan.  Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.

       2          cups  all-purpose flour
       1      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
       1           cup  semisweet chocolate chips
       1           cup  pecans -- coarsely chopped
                        icing:
   1 1/4          cups  powdered sugar
       3   tablespoons  vegetable shortening
       2     teaspoons  milk
       1      teaspoon  light corn syrup
                        red and green chewy candies
                        --or gum drops

Preheat oven to 375 degrees; line 4 cookie sheets with foil and lightly grease the foil.  In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the brown sugar, shortening, milk and vanilla extract until well blended. Beat in the egg.  In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking soda.  With a spoon, stir into the shortening mixture just until blended.  Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans.  Divide the dough into quarters; divide each quarter into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece into a 1-inch ball. Arrange the balls on the cookie sheets almost touching to form an 8-inch circle.  Flatten the balls slightly with your fingers.  Repeat with the remaining balls to make 3 more wreaths.  Bake one cookie sheet at a time for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the wreaths are lightly browned.  Do not overbake.  Cool completely before removing from the cookie sheet.      Meanwhile, prepare the icing.  In a small bowl with the mixer on medium speed, beat the powdered sugar, shortening, milk and corn syrup until smooth.  If too thick, thin with a little milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.  The icing may be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 week. Makes 1 1/2 cups.  Spread or pipe the icing over the cooled wreaths.  Cut the red and green candies as needed for flowers and leaves.  Place in clusters around the wreath. Makes 4 wreaths.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Dissolve the coffee in water in a medium bowl.  Stir in the margarine and powdered sugar. Stir in the flour and 1/2 cup pistachios, using your hands if necessary, until a stiff dough forms.  Divide the dough in half.  Shape each half into a ball.  Pat each ball into a 6-inch round, about 1/2-inch thick, on a lightly floured surface.  Cut each round into 16 wedges.  Arrange the wedges on an ungreased cookie sheet about 1/2 inch apart with the pointed ends toward the center.  Bake for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown.  Immediately remove from the cookie sheet.  Cool completely on wire racks.  Place the remaining 1/2 cup pistachios in a small dish.  Place the chocolate and shortening in a small microwavable bowl. Microwave uncovered on medium power for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring after 2 minutes, until the mixture can be stirred smooth and is drizzling consistency.  Dip one edge of each cookie into the chocolate, then into the nuts.  Place on waxed paper until the chocolate is firm.  Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).

     3/4           Cup  Sugar
       1      Teaspoon  Salt -- optional
   1 1/2     Teaspoons  Vanilla
       2         Large  Eggs
   2 1/2          Cups  All-Purpose Flour
   1 1/4     Teaspoons  Baking Soda
       2          Cups  Walnuts -- coarsely chopped
       3          Cups  Semisweet Chocolate Chips

In a large bowl, beat butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and salt with an electric mixer until creamy and no butter flecks remain.  Beat in eggs and vanilla until well blended. Add flour and baking soda.  With a spoon, stir in walnuts and chocolate chips.

With a small ice cream scoop or 1/4 cup measure (fill cup about half-full), shape dough into 1 1/2-inch-diameter balls (about 2 1/2 Tbsp.) and place close together on 10x15-inch baking pans.  Cover and chill at least 6 hours or up to four days. (If time is short, you can omit chilling step, but cookies may not brown as rapidly.)

To bake, transfer cooky balls to 12x15-inch baking sheets, ungreased or lined with cooking parchment; space balls about 2 1/2 inches apart.  Flatten each ball to a 3/4-inch-thick round: make sides go straight up and depress center of each cooky slightly.  Let cooky dough warm to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Bake in a 400 degree oven until cookies are golden brown all around edges but center 1-inch is still pale, 8 to 10 minutes.  (If you bake 2 pans in 1 oven, switch pan position halfway through baking for more even browning.)  Remove from oven and cool on pans until firm, about 5 minutes.  Then transfer to racks.  Serve cookies warm or cool.

If made more than 1 day ahead, cool, cover, and freeze in an airtight container.  To reheat, place frozen cookies slightly apart on 12x15-inch baking sheets and bake in a 200 degree oven until warm, 12 to 15 minutes.

Makes 3 to 3 1/2 dozen

BEAR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE
IS THIS THE PERFECT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKY?

"The perfect cooky should have a slight crunch on the outside and be soft and very moist on the inside.  It should be thick enough that you can feel your teeth sink into it.  Its flavor should perfectly blend the sweetness of a buttery dough with the semisweetness of the chocolate."  This is the standard Deryl Bear sets at his Hungry Bear Cookies store in Corte Madera and Fresno, California.

Before entering the professional cooky business.  Mr. Bear experimented with batch after batch of cookies to find the secret to moist chewy chocolate chip cookies.  He found his answer in a combination of recipe proportions, shaping technique, and baking precision.

His recipe portions are much like those for traditional chocolate chip cookies, except that he adds more flour and chocolate.  The extra flour helps maintain a plump shape and keeps the cooky from spreading.  Brief baking at a high temperature forms a crust on the outside and maintains a moist, chewy interior.

     1/4           cup  canned, juice-packed pineapple -- crushed,undrained
       4        ounces  light Neufchatel or light cream cheese -- softened and cubed
     1/4      teaspoon  vanilla
                        FRENCH TOAST
       3                extra-large egg whites

       6        slices  French bread -- (1-inch-thick)
                        Sifted confectioner's sugar

In blender container or food processor bowl (or use electric mixer), place the pineapple, cream cheese and vanilla. Cover and process briefly so some chunks of pineapple remain. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
For French toast, in bowl whisk together egg whites, milk, orange juice and cinnamon until well blended. If baking toast immediately, preheat oven to 425'F. Spray 15x l0 x 2-inch jelly-roll pan (or cookie sheet with sides) with aerosol cooking spray. Pour egg mixture into pan. Arrange bread slices in egg mixture, turn to coat well on both sides. (If preparing ahead, cover pans and refrigerate up to 12 hours before baking).
If baking immediately, let bread stand 5 minutes to soak up liquid. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, turning bread slices over halfway through the baking time. To serve, arrange three slices bread on each plate; sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Top with a dollop of Pineapple-Cheese Topping. Serve with remaining topping.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       package  Active Dry Yeast
                        OR
       1    tablespoon  Bulk Active Dry Yeast
     1/4           cup  Warm Water -- (110-115 Deg F)
     1/2           cup  Sugar
       1      teaspoon  Salt
     1/3           cup  Butter OR Regular Margarine
       1    tablespoon  Orange Juice
       2     teaspoons  Rum Extract
       1           cup  Milk -- scalded
                        Unbleached Flour -- up to 4 cups
       2         large  Eggs -- well beaten
                        Fat For Deep Frying -- heated to 375
                        degrees F
                        Jam OR Jelly

Soften the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. 
Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a large bowl. Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir until the butter is melted. Cool to lukewarm.
When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT dough (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes).
About 20 minutes before frying, heat the fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry 2 to 3minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.
Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut. Force about 1/2 teaspoon of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the excess sugar.

                        salt
       1                onion -- chopped
     1/2         pound  fresh mushrooms -- sliced
                        olive oil
       1                minced clove of garlic
                        fresh ground pepper (taste)
       6                eggs
     1/2         pound  feta cheese
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
       1      teaspoon  oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  dried rosemary (optional)
     1/4         pound  butter
       1         pound  phyllo dough

If using fresh spinach, wash the spinach and remove the rough stems.  Place in large bowl and sprinkle heavily with salt.  Rub the salt into the leaves by takin them up, a bunch at a time, and rubbing them between your hands;  the volume of spinach will decrease drastically as you do. Tear the spinach up as you do this. Rinse the salt off thoroughly and dry the spinach, squeezing it in bunches in a towel.  (If using frozen spinach, just let it thaw and squeeze out the excess moisture.) Saute the onion and mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter with the garlic and salt and pepper to taste. When both onions and mushrooms are tender remove from heat. Beat the eggs in a large bowl and crumble in the feta, add the parmesan, then the spinach, onions, mushrooms, stir in the parsley, organo, rosemary, some freshly ground pepper, and a little salt (remembering the feta is very salty)

Spray 1 phyllo sheet with nonstick cooking spray; top with another sheet and spray it. Line the baking pan with these 2 sheets, letting the edges hang over the sides. Spread the spinach mixture over the phyllo. Cover the filling with the more sheets(about 4), spraying each sheet and tucking them into the pan. Fold in the outside sheets. Bake until golden, 30-35 minutes.

 Remove cinnamon stick and add milk-toast mixture to the meat; remove from the heat.  Add cheese and eggs, and mix well.

 Melt remaining butter; butter a pan abt. 2 inches smaller than the phyllo.  Put 7 to 8 phyllo sheets, buttering each before addint it, into the pan, letting phyllo extend on all sides. Pour in meat mixture and spread it ivenly.  Fold overlapping phyllo back onto meat. Butter these well.  Carefully cut remaining sheets of phyllo to fit the top of the pan. Brush each with butter and lay on the filling to make the top of the pitta. Pour on any remaining butter and sprinkle the top very lightly with a little water (to keep phyllo from rising too high). Bake in preheated 350 F. oven for 30 to 40 min. Cool abt. 30 min, and cut into squares to serve.

 NOTE:  It is easier to cut this if you score it lightly before baking.

                        oil for frying
                        -----the filling-----
       1         pound  chopped meat
       2   tablespoons  butter
       1         small  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  tomato sauce
       4   tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- grated
       1                egg white -- beaten with a>>>d
                        few drops of water.
                        parsley -- chopped

Heat milk to lukewarm, pour into a bowl; add yeast. Mix with you fingers.  Add a cup of the flour, and mix to form a ball. Cover the bowl, and set in a warm place. Let the sponge rise until double in bulk. Punch down.  Add vegetable oil, egg yolks, salt and remaining flour, mix well, then knead to make a stiff dough. (Add more water or flour, if necessary.) Cover and let rise again.

 Meantime, brown the meat in butter.  Add onion, and cook until light brown.  Mix in tomato sauce and parsley, and cook abt. 15 to 20 min. Stir in grated cheese.

 Lightly flour a bread board and turn dough out onto it; knead until elastic.  Divide  into small pcs. Flatten these with your hands, or roll into thick round shapes. In the center of each, place a tbs. of the meat mixture.  Fold over dough to form a half-moon shape. Brush edges with a little egg white, and pinch to seal. Flatten the piroski slightly and place on a buttered baking sheed. Set aside in warm place to rise again, but for less time.  Deep-fat fry until a deep golden color. Remove with slotted spoon, drain, and serve hot. Makes about 15 to 18 piroski.

 NOTE 1:  These can be baked instead of fried.  To bake follow the directions above to the final rising, then brush tops with egg white, and bake in preheated 350 F. oven until golden brown.

 NOTE 2:  The filling can be of chicken, ham, fish, or hard-cooked eggs. For any of these, chop the filling and mix with Bechamel sauce, or mashed potaotes.

                        spalding
       6        ounces  tarama (cod roe)
       8        slices  white bread -- trimmed
   1 1/2          cups  best olive oil (more if need
       2                lemons -- juiced (or to taste)
       1           sm.  onion -- chopped fine
                        parsley -- chopped (opt.)
                        chives -- chopped (opt.)

Put the tarama in a mixer or blender.  Wet the bread and thoroughly squeeze out the excess water; add to the tarama. Add a little oil, and beat until thoroughly blended. Add onions and continue to mix. Pour additional oil slowly into the tarama, beating constantly, to make a smooth, cream-colored paste. Add lemon juice, a little at a time, to taste. The consistency and taste of the taramosalata are a matter of individual preference.  Some prefer it made with a little more bread; others like more lemon juice, some like less. No matter: the end result is always a tasty, rather thick, versatile diplike sauce.  Serve it in a bowl, with crackers or crusty bread, onion slices, etc., to "go with." Or garnish with parsley and olives for a festive platter.  Or use as salad dressing.

 NOTE:  Taramosalata in generally placed on the Greek table at the start of the meal and can be tasted at will throughout the meal.

                        spalding

       1                onion, med. -- chopped
     1/2           cup  scallions -- chopped
       1           cup  butter
     1/2           cup  dill -- chopped
     1/2           cup  parsley -- chopped
                        salt & pepper to taste
     1/2           cup  evaporated milk
       5                egg
     3/4         pound  phyllo pastry
                        melted butter as needed
     1/2         pound  feta cheese -- crumbled

Wash spinach in plenty of water and cut in sm. pcs.; place in bowl. Salt lightly; stir to spread salt evenly. Take spinach, a handful at a time, and squeeze out the excess water; place it in another bowl. Saute the onion in half the butter until it is a light, golden color; add the scallions and cook untill they wilt. Add spinach; stir until all vegs. take on a light color.  Stir in the dill, parsley, salt and pepper; cover the pot and cook until all the water thrown off by the spinach is absorbed. Remove from the heat; turn into a bowl, and immediately add the milk (to cool the spinach). Beat the eggs in another bowl and add the cheese to them; add to the cooled spinach; mix well.

 Line a pan with 8 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with the melted butter before topping it with the next sheet. Do not trim the overhanging sections. Pour in the spinach mixture, spreading it evenly over the phyllo.  Fold the part of the phyllo that extends out of the pan back over the filling. Lay the remaining phyllo on top, again brushing each sheet with melted butter before adding the next. Now trim the overlap. Brush additional melted butter on top of the pie and score it into square or diamond-shaped serving pcs. Bake for 30 to 45 min. in a preheated 300 F. oven; let it stand for 30 min. before serving.

 NOTE:  This can also be made without precooking the spinach. In that case, squeeze the spinach free of as much water as possible, mix it with the seasonings, and proceed as above, baking it for 1 hr.

Clean, scrape, and wash the tripe and feet.  Scald in boiling water; cool.  Cut the tripe into small pieces, place in a large pot with the feet, cover with plenty of water; bring to a boil, skimming off the froth as it rises.  Lower the heat.  Add the garlic, and cook at a slow boil for 1 to 2 hrs., adding a little coarse salt just before the meat is tender. Remove the pot from the heat; strain the broth and reserve. Remove and discard the bones from the feet; cut the meat into 3 or 4 pcs.; return to the broth.

 Prepare the avgolemono as follows:  Beat the eggs very well. Slowly add the lemon juice to them, beating all the while. Add a little hot broth from the pot, stirring constatly, then pour the mixture back into the soup. Add pepper just before serving.

 NOTE:  This soup, very light in color, can be served not only hot but cold.  For the latter, let it jell, then cut into squares or diamonds for serving. When it is served hot, some people prefer it mixed with oil and vinegar, instead in avgolemono.

Have meat ground twice.  Soak bread in cold water and squeeze out the excess well.  Mix meat, bread, garlic, and cumin together; form egg-shaped meatballs; roll lightly in the flour. Heat butter or oil in a deep frying pan.  Fry the soudzoukakia until brown on all sides. Remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and put them into a pot. Pour the tomatoes (or diluted tomato paste) into the pan with the butter or oil and cook together for 3 to 5 min.  Serve with rice.

 NOTE:  If you are using the egg and wine, add both to the mixture, and use 1 more slice of bread.

One of the nicest Greek customs is the use of red eggs for the Easter celebration.  It is unthinkable to set an Easter table without these eggs, for they add to the celebration and happy atmosphere.

 To prepare:

 Carefully wash and dry each egg.  Set a large pot of water to boil. Add a red dye or food coloring and 3/4 cup of vinegar to the water, and boil for a few minutes. Slowly lower the eggs into the pot, and when the water comes to a boil, lower the heat.  Let eggs simmer for 15 min., then remove them carefully from the pot. If you plan to cook more eggs, add an additional 2 tbs. vinegar to the water.  Wipe cooked eggs with an oil-soaked cotton ball, then wipe each egg with a clean dry cloth. Place on a platter. Serve cold.

                        almonds
                        walnuts

Select fresh tender beets and cut off the tops and roots. Wash the beets, without removing the skins, and boil in a large pot with ample water.  Meanwhile, clean the beet greens with the stems; add to the pot after the beets have cooked 30 min.  When beets are tender, remove and strain the liquid.  Peel the beets and cut them into round slices; chop up the greens. Mound greens in center of a platter and surround them with the beet slices.  Pour oil and vinegar over all, and serve. or serve with Skordalia (garlic) Sauce. Serve hot or cold.

 SKORDALIA SAUCE:  Clean garlic and mash it completely (you may use food processor).  Mash in potatoes, one by one, until you have a thick paste (the more potatoes you use, the more sauce you get--but less potent). Alternately add the oil and vinegar, beating constantly. If the sauce is too thick for your taste, add a little water or fish or chicken stock. NO LUMPS IN THIS SAUCE, P-L-E-A-S-E !!  NOTE:  Many people like to add almonds or walnuts to skordalia. These are mashed to a pulp and added to the paste before the potatoes, oil, and vinegar.

Combine ground beef, onion and garlic in a large frying-pan; cook, stirring frequently until beef loses pink color. Pour off drippings. Add mushrooms, bay leaf, salt, chili powder, cumin powder, and cinnamon; cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are tender about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce and wine; cook, covered, 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaf. Cool while preparing cheese filling. 
Combine egg and cream cheese in medium bowl, beat with electric mixer until smooth. Stir in cottage and feta cheeses and blend. Brush 13 x 9-inch baking pan with melted butter. Line pan with 1 sheet of pastry, fitting pastry to contour of pan. (Pastry will come up over edges of pan.) Brush pastry with butter. Layer with 3 more pastry sheets, brushing each with butter. Sprinkle bread crumbs evenly over top. Spoon 1/5 of meat filling in layer over crumbs and 1/5 of the cheese filling over meat. Place 1 pastry sheet over cheese filling, crinkling to fit inside dimensions of pan; brush with butter and layer with 1/5 of the meat and 1/5 to the cheese fillings. Repeat with 3 more pastry sheets, crinkling each, brushing with butter and topping with fillings. Turn bottom pastry ends up over filling. Place remaining 8 pastry sheets smoothly over top, brushing each with butter. Using spatula, tuck top pastry sheets around inside edges of pan. With sharp knife, score top lightly in half lengthwise and sixths crosswise. (Do not cut through) Bake in moderate oven (350 degrees F ) 1 hour or until top is golden brown. Cool at least 10 minutes before cutting along scored lines. 
Place a cherry tomato on each of 12 small wooden picks and insert pick in center of each serving. Garnish with parsley. Garnish individual servings with fresh fruit kabobs, if desired.

      16        ounces  tomatoes
       7        ounces  green chiles -- diced
       1                onion -- cut into chunks
       3          cups  chicken broth -- or homemade turkey
                        stock
       3          cups  cooked turkey -- bite sized pieces
       2          cups  cooked brown rice
       1      10 ounce  wh  kernel corn, frozen
     3/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder

This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers.  I use the carcass to make the stock first.  I throw in any vegetables I want to use up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident.  I simmer the stock about 2 hours or so.  After straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call for, I really don't measure the ingredients, I just add what I've got until it's as thick as I want it and the proportions look right. In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles and onion; whirl until smooth.  Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring to a boil over high heat.  Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices.  Reduce heat and simmer until heated through. Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn sometimes too.

       2                garlic bulbs
       2         large  yellow onions
       2                leeks -- white part only
       4   tablespoons  olive oil -- butter, or
                        butter/oil
      26         ounce  tomatoes -- chopped, or 1 can pl
       1                dried ancho peppers -- optional
       1         quart  tomato broth -- see note
       1         quart  chicken broth -- or vegetable broth
                        or
       6          cups  water
                        rosemary
                        basil
                        parsley
                        sea salt
                        pepper
       8         ounce  macaroni
                        parmesan cheese -- optional

Separate the garlic bulbs into cloves and peel.  Divide garlic cloves into three piles.  Mince onions with one third of the garlic cloves (I use a food processor).  Heat oil or butter in large (6 quart or more) pot and saute onion and garlic until soft but not brown. Slice leeks thinly with another third of the garlic cloves (I use the food processor again, with a #2 slicing disk, but any slicing disk works fine, as does a knife), and add to the pot.  Saute until soft. Remove the stem and seeds from the ancho peppers.  Add the tomatoes, broths and water to the pot; then add the herbs and ancho peppers.  (I always have cheesecloth around, so I usually chop up the fresh herbs and put them with the dried ancho pepper in a piece of cheesecloth that I tie up like a bag; this makes it easy to fish the herbs and ancho out at the end, which makes the soup prettier.) Bring to a boil, cover the pot, lower the heat and simmer for two hours until the onion and leek have pretty well melted into the soup.  If fishing the herbs and ancho pepper out of the soup isn't too messy, do it now.  Slice the reserved garlic very very thinly, and add to the soup pot.  Add water if it has gotten too thick. Simmer covered, for 30 minutes. If you are going to save the soup and serve it tomorrow, stop here, cool and refrigerate it.  Otherwise, keep going.  10 minutes before serving, uncover the pot, taste the soup, season with salt and pepper and bring to a rolling boil.  Add the macaroni, and cook for a couple minutes less than you usually would, because you aren't going to drain it.  Or, cook the macaroni separately and add it just before you ladle the soup into bowls. Grate a little parmesan cheese over the top, if you like.  
NOTE:  Tomato broth:  I use a recipe adapted from one of Molly O'Neill's Sunday New York Times Magazine columns:  for one quart of tomato broth, chop four pounds or more or fresh or canned plum tomatoes (or use 4 lbs of Pomi tomatoes in the box, which come already chopped), and put in a 4 quart pot with 1 teaspoon sea salt, 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh basil, 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, and 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary. Bring just to a boil, stirring, and then strain immediately through a fine mesh strainer (stirring the mixture from time to time with a wire whisk will help it get through the strainer.)

Bring mixture to a boil, cover, and simmer about 10 minutes (until celery is crisp-tender). Meanwhile, in a small bowl or cup, combine cornstarch and water.  Add mixture to broth and cook, stirring until it thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes. Lower heat so that soup simmers gently. 

In 2 or 3 batches, add cheese to soup, stirring well after each batch.  Stir until cheese melts.  Continue to stir gently simmering soup 2-3 minutes more. Do NOT allow it to come to a full boil. Keeps in refrigerator 1-2 days.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       1       5 pound  chicken OR -- (5 to 6)
       1         pound  chicken gizzards
       2        pounds  chicken backs -- AND
       1         pound  chicken legs and thighs
       3        quarts  water
       1                onion stuck with 2 cloves
       1                leek
       1                carrot
                        salt -- to taste
      10                peppercorns
     1/2           cup  onion -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  carrots -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  green beans -- finely cut
       4        ounces  egg noodles
       1           cup  frozen or fresh peas
                        parsley -- chopped

Place the whole chicken or the chicken pieces in a heavy 6-quart kettle with the water, onion stuck with cloves, leek, carrot, 1 tablespoon salt, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil and skim off any scum that forms on top. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours. Correct the seasoning. 

If you are using chicken parts, cook until they are tender 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the chicken, skim excess fat from the broth, and then remove the vegetables.  (If you are not serving the soup till the next day, it will be easier to remove the fat if the broth is cooled and then chilled.) Pour the broth into a container, wash out the kettle, and then return the broth to it.  

Add the cut vegetables, the meat from the legs and thighs cut into small dice, and the gizzards thinly sliced. Bring to a boil again and cook just until the vegetables begin to tenderize and are pleasantly firm.  Add the noodles (increase the amount if you like a very thick soup) and peas, and boil for 5 to 9 minutes or until they are cooked. 

Serve in heated soup plates or bowls and sprinkle with some chopped parsley. This deliciously filling soup is idea 1 for a Sunday supper, accompanied by buttered toast or hot rolls, perhaps followed by a salad or some excellent cheese and a bottle of red wine

                        parsley -- chopped
       1         slice  lemon
      10                peppercorns
       1      teaspoon  salt
       3          cups  chicken stock
       1        pounds  sweet Italian sausages -- cut into 1 inch piec
       1           cup  pasta shells
       2        medium  zucchini -- grated (abt 2/3#)
                        salt and pepper -- to taste

Place the chicken in a 6-quart pot.  Add all the ingredients through the parsnip, plus the parsley sprigs, lemon slice, peppercorns, and 1 tsp salt. Add the chicken stock and enough water to cover the chicken by 2 inches. Heat to boiling, skimming any residue as it gathers. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, 1 hour.  Remove the chicken from the stock and set the stock aside. Allow the chicken to cool enough to handle, then carefully remove the meat from the bones and cut it into bite-size pieces. Cover and reserve. Return the bones and skin to the stock.  Return it to the  boil; reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 45 minutes. Strain the stock into another pot, pressing the vegetables gently with the back of a spoon to release their juices. Meanwhile, saute the sausage pieces in a lightly oiled heavy skillet until well browned, about 8 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Add the sausages to the stock. Heat to boiling; reduce the heat. Simmer, uncovered, skimming any fat that rises to the surface, for 20 minutes. Add the pasta shells; cook 10 minutes longer. Add the zucchini and the reserved chicken; cook 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with the chopped parsley.

                        salt and pepper -- to taste

In a large non-stick soup pot over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until lightly brown.  Add ginger and onion, stir for a minute.  Add chicken pieces and fish  sauce and cook for another 3 minutes.  Add rice, water and a little salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer in medium low heat for about 40 minutes or until the consistency of a light creamed soup has been reached.  

Stir occasionally while cooking.  Correct seasonings to taste.  Stir in a small amount of sliced green onions.  If rice soup becomes too thick, add a little water to thin it a bit.  Garnish individual bowl servings with sliced green onions just before servings. Tips: If you prefer, sprinkle a little lemon juice on the soup servings. This will give a pleasant tartness to the dish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  baby lima beans
     1/4           cup  small white beans
     1/4           cup  black-eyed beans

       1      teaspoon  salt
       1           cup  onion -- chopped
       1           cup  celery -- chopped
       1           cup  carrot -- chopped
     1/2           cup  green bell pepper -- chopped
     1/2           cup  dried parsley -- minced
       1         clove  garlic -- crushed
       2   tablespoons  butter or margarine
       2     envelopes  chicken noodle soup mix -- 2 ounces each
     1/2                bay leaf -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  fines herbes
       1           cup  tomato* -- chopped
                        parmesan cheese -- grated

To soak beans:  For each pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups hot
water.  Up to 2 teaspoons of salt per pound of beans may be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.  Heat to boiling, let boil 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least one hour, but preferably
four hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater amount of sugars to dissolve, thus helping the beans to be more easily digested.  Always discard the soak water.  To maintain color integrity, soak beans separately. 

Drain beans.  Cook onion, celery, carrot, green pepper, parsley and garlic in
butter until soft.  Combine cooked vegetables with soup mix, 2 quarts water,
bay leaf, fine herbs and soaked beans.  Simmer, covered, about 1 hour to
desired tenderness.  Add tomato.  Serve hot, sprinkled with cheese.

Wash chicken pieces and place in large stockpot. Cover with water and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken falls off the bones (approximately 2-3 hours). Remove chicken with slotted spoon and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove bones and skin and cut all chicken up in small pieces, being careful not to leave any bones. Add chicken to stock left in pan and refrigerate overnight. When you remove pot from refrigerator, skim off the grease from the top of the stock (the chicken will be very moist from having remained in the stock overnight). Return pot to heat and slowly bring to boil. Add onions, celery, carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and potatoes.  Add bouillon, bay leaf, salt and pepper, marjoram, basil, thyme and parsley and simmer until vegetables are done to your liking. 

Then add broken pieces of spaghetti and cook until tender. The soup will be very thick, almost stew-like. It freezes well.

                        salt and pepper -- to taste
       2   tablespoons  butter
       3                leeks -- with 1" green -- sli
       2                granny smith apples -- peeled
       1           cup  apple juice
     1/2           cup  vinegar
       3          cups  chicken stock
       3   tablespoons  calvados
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Melt the butter over medium heat
in a saute pan just large enough to hold the chicken.  Add the chicken, skin
side down, and cook for about eight minutes over medium heat. If the butter
in the pan starts to brown, lower the heat slightly. Turn the chicken and
light saute in the same way for five minutes more.

Remove the chicken from the pan and place it in a bowl.  If the butter in
the saute pan has burned, pour it out and replace it with two tablespoons
fresh butter.  Add the leeks and cook them for 10 minutes over medium heat.
Stir the leeks every couple of minutes.  They should be soft but not brown.  

Put the chicken back in the pan with the leeks.  Add the apples, apple juice, vinegar and broth.  Bring the liquids to a slow simmer and with a ladle skim off any fat or froth that floats to the top.  Cover the pot and simmer the chicken very gently for 10 to 15 minutes, until it is completely cooked.  

Remove the chicken and let it cool.  Remove and discard the skin and pull the meat away from the bones.  Cut the meat into half inch chunks.  Use a ladle to skim off any fat that has formed on the surface of the liquid in a saute pan.  Add the Calvados and the heavy cream.  Bring to a simmer and season to taste with salt and pepper.  

Heat the chunks of chicken in the soup for two minutes and serve immediately in hot bowls. Suggestions and variations:  Try adding a cup of sliced mushrooms along with the apples.  The mushroom flavor goes well with the other ingredients, and the mushrooms make the soup more substantial.  

This soup is also delicious with curry, which can be added by gently cooking a tablespoon of curry powder in a tablespoon of butter and stirring it into the soup shortly before serving.

Remove skin from chicken and place in a soup pot. Add stock, wine, ginger, and onions and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is just cooked through, skimming off any scum and fat that rises to the surface. Do not boil or stock will become cloudy.  Remove stems from Shiitake and add to stock. 

Slice shiitake caps thickly and quickly saute in drops of olive oil until lightly browned. Set aside.  Remove chicken from pot and cut meat into long slivers discarding bones.  Strain stock carefully and discard ginger, onions and shiitake stems. Wash out pot and add the cabbage and cook for 2 minutes. 

Add chicken, spinach and sesame oil and cook for one minute more. Correct seasoning with salt and pepper and serve at once.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        medium  avocado
       1         large  tomato -- diced
       4                scallion -- with top, sliced
       1                chile serrano -- minced
       2   tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
       2                lime -- Mexican

Make the chicken soup from a well-grown hen with pieces of meat, skinned  and boned, left in.  The pieces should be fairly large; this is a main dish soup.  *The rice should be cooked in the soup.   Peel and slice the avocados, and cut into 1" pieces.  

The chiles are best chopped fine in a blender.  Halve the limes.  Pour soup into hot earthenware cazuelas, or onion-soup pots, and spoon on the uncooked topping.  Serve with hot tortillas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2        pounds  frying chicken -- cut up in 2 inch pie
       1                thumb size  ginger root -- OR
       2     teaspoons  powdered ginger
       2         large  tomatoes -- quartered
       1         small  garlic cloves -- mashed
     3/4         pound  mongo beans -- boiled and peeled
       2    tablespoon  patis or fish sauce
       1           can  anchovy -- fish fillets may be
       1      teaspoon  MSG
       2    tablespoon  oil

Fry chicken in oil until slightly brown, stirring constantly. Add ginger and garlic and stir until garlic is browned. Add tomatoes until soft, then add 4 cups of water. Add anchovy and cook if it is used instead of patis. Bring to boil, then simmer until chicken is tender. While chicken is simmering, boil beans in water until they are easy to peel.  

This is done by placing a bean between your fingers and rubbing the skin off the beans. When this is done with ease, remove from stove and drain. Add cold water to beans and then rub beans between your palms until almost all of the beans have been peeled. Keep   replacing cold water and peeling will drain with water. When chicken is tender, add beans to soup and cook until soup is thick and beans are soft. Add water, if necessary, 5 minutes before it is done add the patis if anchovies are not available. Variation: Bitter melons, cut in squares or leafy vegetables such as spinach may be used. Pork may be used instead of   chicken.

       8          cups  homemade chicken broth

       1         stalk  celery -- chopped
       2        cloves  garlic -- peeled and crushed
       1      teaspoon  salt
   1 1/2          cups  fresh breadcrumbs
     2/3           cup  grated Parmesan cheese -- plus extra for garni
       1      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated
       2         large  eggs
       1           cup  fresh parsley -- chopped

Pour chicken broth into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Add carrots, celery, garlic and salt.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, combine breadcrumbs, cheese and nutmeg.  Make a well in the center and add eggs; mix until thoroughly combined.  

The dough should be damp but firm.  If necessary, incorporate additional breadcrumbs or a few drops of water; if the dough is too wet or too dry it will crumble.  To form the passatelli, pinch off a piece of dough and roll it about 1/4 inch thick, then break it into 1/2 inch lengths. 

sContinue forming the rest of the dough in the same manner.  Bring the broth back to a boil, add the passatelli and parsley and cook for 5 minutes. Ladle the soup into bowls, sprinkle with a little Parmesan and serve.

                        west African red pepper
                        salt

Stem and chop greens.  Put chicken, onion and mushrooms in soup pot.  Add enough water to just barely cover ingredients.  Turn on medium-high heat.  Cover and cook while you're washing and chopping the greens, about 10 minutes.  Add salt, red pepper and tomato paste.  Boil for about another 5 or 10 minutes.  Add greens and replace lid, steaming greens and stirring them in. Variations: sometimes we add some exotic ingredients like smoked fish and/or ground egusi (which is a kind of melon seed), but it's perfectly tasty without these additions. This is traditionally served with "fufu" which is a doughy starch made variously from gari (roasted, fermented, ground cassava), or from semolina flour or from various combinations of Bisquick, potato Buds, potato starch, etc. It's also good over rice.

Reduce the heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  

Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle. Remove from the heat.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.  

Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or slightly stale bread.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
       2         pound  chestnuts -- fresh
       2                carrots
       2                parsnips
       1         small  onion
       1         clove  garlic
       2                scallion
       3         stalk  celery
       4   tablespoons  butter
       5          cups  brown stock
       1                bouquet  garni
       3   tablespoons  amaretto liqueur
       1          cups  cream -- heavy
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
                        cayenne pepper
                        nutmeg

Make a slash in the rounded side of each chestnut and roast in a pre- heated 400 F. oven for 5 minutes.  Peel off the shell and inner skin. Peel the carrots,  parsnip, onion, and garlic.  Finely chop all of the vegetables, including the scallions and celery.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  

Add the vegetables and cook for five minutes, or until soft but not brown.  Add the chestnuts, stock, and bouquet garni. Gently simmer the soup for 40 minutes, or until the chestnuts are very soft.  Remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup in a blender or food processor.  Return the soup to the  saucepan, adding the amaretto, two- thirds of the cream, and salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to taste; the soup should be very flavorful.  

If a   sweeter flavor is desired, add a spoonful of brown sugar.  To serve, ladle the chestnut soup into warmed bowls.  Pour a little of the remaining cream into each bowl and marble it into the soup, stirring with a skewer.  Chestnut soup is extremely rich, so keep the rest of the meal simple.
